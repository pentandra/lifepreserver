  label: Interdependence
  abstract: Interdependence describes relationships in which members of the group
    are mutually dependent on the others. This concept differs from a dependence relationship,
    where some members are dependent and some are not. In an interdependent relationship,
    participants may be emotionally, economically, ecologically and/or morally reliant
    on and responsible to each other. An interdependent relationship can arise between
    two or more cooperative autonomous participants (e.g. a co-op). Some people advocate
    freedom or independence as the ultimate good; others do the same with devotion
    to one's family, community, or society. Interdependence can be a common ground
    between these aspirations.

Decisions:
  uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision-making
  label: Decision-making
  abstract: Decision-making can be regarded as the cognitive process resulting in
    the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities.
    Every decision-making process produces a final choice that may or may not prompt
    action. Decision making is one of the central activities of management and is
    a huge part of any process of implementation. Good decision making is an essential
    skill to become an effective leader and for a successful career. Decision making
    is the study of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values and
    preferences of the decision maker. Making a decision implies that there are alternative
    choices to be considered, and in such a case we want not only to identify as many
    of these alternatives as possible but to choose the one that has the highest probability
    of success or effectiveness and best fits with our goals, desires, lifestyle,
    values, and so on.

  label: Essay
  abstract: ! 'Essays are generally short pieces of writing written from an author''s
    personal point of view, but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of
    an article, a pamphlet and a short story.Essays can consist of a number of elements,
    including: literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations
    of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern
    essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g.
    Alexander Pope''s An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). While brevity usually
    defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke''s An Essay Concerning Human
    Understanding and Thomas Malthus''s An Essay on the Principle of Population are
    counterexamples.In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays
    have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured
    essay formats to improve their writing skills, and admission essays are often
    used by universities in selecting applicants and, in the humanities and social
    sciences, as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.The
    concept of an "essay" has been extended to other mediums beyond writing. A film
    essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary film making styles and which
    focuses more on the evolution of a theme or an idea. A photographic essay is an
    attempt to cover a topic with a linked series of photographs; it may or may not
    have an accompanying text or captions.'

  label: Funding
  abstract: Funding is the act of providing resources, usually in form of money (financing),
    or other values such as effort or time (sweat equity), for a project, a person,
    a business, or any other private or public institutions. The process of soliciting
    and gathering fund is known as fundraising. Sources of funding include credit,
    venture capital, donations, grants, savings, subsidies, and taxes. Fundings such
    as donations, subsidies, and grants that have no direct requirement for return
    of investment are described as "soft funding" or "crowdfunding". Funding that
    facilitates the exchange of equity ownership in a company for capital investment
    via an online funding portal as per the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (alternately,
    the "JOBS Act of 2012") (U.S.) is known as equity crowdfunding. Funds can be allocated
    for either short-term or long-term purposes.

  label: Genealogy
  abstract: ! 'Genealogy (from Greek: γενεά genea, "generation"; and λόγος logos,
    "knowledge"), also known as family history, is the study of families and the tracing
    of their lineages and history. Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records,
    genetic analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to
    demonstrate kinship and pedigrees of its members. The results are often displayed
    in charts or written as narratives. The pursuit of family history and origins tends
    to be shaped by several motivations, including the desire to carve out a place
    for one''s family in the larger historical picture, a sense of responsibility
    to preserve the past for future generations, and a sense of self-satisfaction
    in accurate storytelling.'

Holism:
  uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holism
  label: Holism
  abstract: Holism is the idea that natural systems (physical, biological,
    chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic, etc.) and their properties
    should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts. This often
    includes the view that systems function as wholes and that their
    functioning cannot be fully understood solely in terms of their component
    parts. The term holism is derived from Ancient Greek holos ὅλος, meaning
    "all, whole, entire, total." Reductionism is often viewed as the opposite
    of holism. Reductionism in science says that a complex system can be
    explained by reduction to its fundamental parts. For example, the processes
    of biology are reducible to chemistry and the laws of chemistry are
    explained by physics.Social scientist and physician Nicholas A. Christakis
    explains that "for the last few centuries, the Cartesian project in science
    has been to break matter down into ever smaller bits, in the pursuit of
    understanding.  And this works, to some extent... but putting things back
    together in order to understand them is harder, and typically comes later
    in the development of a scientist or in the development of science."

    in 1903 in Washington, D.C.. Its headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia. The goals
    of the organization are to promote genealogical skill development, establish high
    standards of genealogical research, and increase awareness of and interest in
    family history. To accomplish this, the National Genealogical Society provides
    educational programs, publishes several publications in the field of genealogy,
    and creates networking opportunities for its members. It is the publisher of the
    National Genealogical Society Quarterly, and the NGS Magazine. Annually, in conjunction
    with a sponsoring local genealogical society, it stages the "NGS Family History
    Conference."

Open Access:
  uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_access
  label: Open access
  abstract: ! 'Open access (OA) means unrestricted online access to peer-reviewed
    scholarly research. Open access is primarily intended for scholarly journal articles,
    but is also provided for a growing number of theses, book chapters, and scholarly
    monographs. Open access comes in two degrees: gratis OA, which is free online access,
    and libre OA, which is free online access plus some additional usage rights. These
    additional usage rights are often granted through the use of various specific
    Creative Commons licenses. The two ways authors can provide open access are (1)
    by self-archiving their journal articles in an OA repository, also known as ''green''
    OA, or by (2) by publishing in an open access journal, known as ''gold'' OA.With
    green OA authors publish in any journal and then self-archive a version of the
    article for gratis public use in their institutional repository, in a central
    repository (such as PubMed Central), or on some other open access website.With
    gold OA, authors publish in open access journals, which provide immediate open
    access to all of their articles, usually on the publisher''s website. "Hybrid"
    gold OA journals are subscription journals that provide gold open access only
    for those individual articles for which their authors (or their author''s institution
    or funder) pay an open access publishing fee.Public access to the World Wide Web
    became widespread in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The low-cost distribution
    technology has fueled the open access movement, and prompted both the green open
    access self-archiving of non-open access journal articles and the creation of
    gold open access journals. Conventional non-open access journals cover publishing
    costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view.
    Some non-open access journals provide open access after an embargo period of 6–12
    months or longer (see delayed open access journals). Active debate over the economics
    and reliability of various ways of providing open access continues among researchers,
    academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government
    officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers.'

    movements like free software, open source, open content and open tools and standards.
    The approach places value on transparency, stakeholder inclusion, and accountability.Open
    business structures make contributors and non-contributors visible so that business
    benefits are distributed accordingly. They seek to increase personal engagement
    and positive outcomes by rewarding contributors in an open way.

Open Research:
  uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_research
  label: Open research
  abstract: Open research is research conducted in the spirit of free and open source
    software. Much like open source schemes that are built around a source code that
    is made public, the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of
    the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results
    extracted or derived from them. This permits a massively distributed collaboration,
    and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project. If the research
    is scientific in nature, it is frequently referred to as open science. Open research
    can also include social sciences, the humanities, mathematics, engineering and
    medicine.

Open Standards:
  uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_standard
  label: Open standard
  abstract: An open standard is a standard that is publicly available and has various
    rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how
    it was designed (e.g. open process). There is no single definition and interpretations
    vary with usage.The terms "open" and "standard" have a wide range of meanings
    associated with their usage. There are a number of definitions of open standards
    which emphasize different aspects of openness, including of the resulting specification,
    the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard.
    The term "standard" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized
    committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate
    on a consensus basis.The definitions of the term "open standard" used by academics,
    the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark,
    France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New
    Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation
    side, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ensures that its specifications can
    be implemented on a royalty-free basis. Many definitions of the term "standard"
    permit patent holders to impose "reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing"
    royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers and/or users of the standard.
    For example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized
    standards bodies such as the IETF, ISO, IEC, and ITU-T permit their standards
    to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent
    licensing fees. Among these organizations, only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly
    refer to their standards as "open standards," while the others refer only to producing
    "standards." The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of "open standard" that allow
    "reasonable and non-discriminatory" patent licensing fee requirements.There are
    those in the open-source software community who hold that an "open standard" is
    only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented and extended. While open standards
    or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard
    is either un-owned or owned by a collective body it can still be publicly shared
    and not tightly guarded. The typical example of “open source” that has become
    a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel,
    the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor. There
    are three others that are most widely accepted as “open” which include the GSM
    phones (adopted as a government standard), Open Group which promotes UNIX and
    the like, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which created the first
    standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they
    believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network
    effects and increased competition between vendors.Open standards which specify
    formats are sometimes referred to as open formats.Many specifications that are
    sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive
    contract terms (if they can be obtained at all) from the organization that owns
    the copyright on the specification. As such these specifications are not considered
    to be fully Open. Joel West has argued that "open" standards are not black and
    white but have many different levels of "openness". Ultimately a standard needs
    to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market, but
    still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing
    the technology around the standard. A more open standard tends to occur when the
    knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased
    and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it. This
    occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the
    software. Less open standards exist when a particular firm has a lot of power
    (not ownership) over the standard which can occur when a firm’s platform “wins”
    in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular.

Review:

  label: Review
  abstract: A review is an evaluation of a publication, product, service, or company
    such as a movie (a movie review), video game, musical composition (music review
    of a composition or recording), book (book review); a piece of hardware like a
    car, home appliance, or computer; or an event or performance, such as a live music
    concert, play, musical theater show, or dance show. In addition to a critical
    evaluation, the review's author may assign the work a rating to indicate its relative
    merit. More loosely, an author may review current events, trends, or items in
    the news. A compilation of reviews may itself be called a review. The New York
    Review of Books, for instance, is a collection of essays on literature, culture,
    and current affairs. National Review, founded by William F. Buckley, Jr., is an
    influential conservative magazine, and Monthly Review is a long-running socialist
    periodical.In the scientific literature, review articles are a category of scientific
    paper, which provides a synthesis of research on a topic at that moment in time.
    A compilation of these reviews forms the core content of a 'secondary' scientific
    journal, with examples including Annual Reviews, the Nature Reviews series of
    journals and Trends. A peer review is the process by which scientists assess the
    work of their colleagues that has been submitted for publication in the scientific
    literature. A software review is also a form of peer review, by the co-workers.A
    consumer review refers to a review written by the owner of a product or the user
    of a service who has sufficient experience to comment on reliability and whether
    or not the product or service delivers on its promises, otherwise known as product
    reviews. Product reviews can be done either individually, or as a comparison to
    similar products. An expert review usually refers to a review written by someone
    who has tested several peer products or services to identify which offers the
    best value for money or the best set of features. A bought review is the system
    where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review
    his new product.

Technology:

  label: Technology
  abstract: ! 'Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand";
    and -λογία, -logia) is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools,
    machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to
    solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal,
    handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can
    also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications,
    arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as
    other animal species'' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments.
    The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include
    construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.The human
    species'' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into
    simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased
    the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in
    travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments,
    including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical
    barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.
    However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development
    of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history,
    from clubs to nuclear weapons. Technology has affected society and its surroundings
    in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced
    economies (including today''s global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure
    class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution,
    and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth''s environment. Various
    implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology
    often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of
    efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines,
    and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over
    the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether
    technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism,
    and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern
    world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents
    of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological
    progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently,
    it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human
    beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain
    dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge
    to other generations.'
