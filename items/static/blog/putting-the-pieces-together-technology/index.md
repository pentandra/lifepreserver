Don't worry---this is not what you think. This post is not about specific
technologies, but about what needs to be enabled by technology to allow for
scholarly commoning. It is a follow-on to a post that I wrote about the
[_culture_ of the Scholarly Commons][culture]. We need technology that will
enable that culture, and it is currently missing.

# On gaps and systems

One of the topics that pops up every once in a while in our discussions is the
concept of _compliance_. I think this comes from the desire to know where the
boundaries of the Scholarly Commons are, and following that line of thought,
the question of whether or not something belongs within the commons is based
upon whether that thing _complies_ with certain principles of openness or
reusability.

As much as I love and support open-source software and tooling, I think that,
for us, this argument has been more of a red herring, missing the whole point
of what the Scholarly Commons is about. To me the issue is less about
compliance, and more about enabling interactions. We are either commoning, or
we're not. Nevertheless, the main track of the workshop was designed to lead
the workshop participants through an exercise of 'compliance checking' existing
tools to see how well they conformed to the latest rendition of the principles
of the Scholarly Commons.

In the days leading up to the workshop, I struggled to understand the point of
going through such an exercise. The hope was, as far as I could tell, that we
could find a new system by looking at elements of the old system, and filling
in any gaps that we find. But cultural change and innovation don't happen that
way. We were not going to discover some preexisting solution that has been
waiting for us out there just by looking at all the components. We need
something more.

To explain what I mean by this _something more_, allow me to share a comparable
approach and the resulting struggle in the practice of medicine:

Research, just like medicine, is not simply the matter of lining up tools into
a usable workflow. We need to approach this problem in a systemic way.

# The exercise

So despite my initial struggles, we went forward with the compliance exercise,
and it was actually very enlightening in some unexpected ways. First, it was
good to talk about current practices. So much of my time I spend thinking, _'If
we could start over from scratch, what would the world look like?'_ and I don't
spend as much time thinking about the difficulties of transition that others
are facing as well as I need to. For example, one participant was threatened
with dismissal from her doctoral program for wanting to publish a paper open
access. Compared with Open Access, what we're trying to do is space age. As
much as it sounds nice, and [as happy as it would be to work in this new
world][happy place], the transition to new ways of working together is not
going to happen overnight. It is not enough to know what our destination
is---we also need to know how to get there from where we are now.

![Humanities workflows on transparency overlaid](humanities_workflows_overlaid_620x.jpg)

Here are a few of the thoughts that emerged from the exercise:

* Bad tools are used to perform good things.
* People use what they use because it works.
* It's way more useful to think of what we are trying to _achieve_ with a tool,
  rather than any intrinsic quality of compliance.
* Practice is more important than tools.
* Tools can actively hinder open if the outputs are not machine-accessible.

# The process is the product

As I was sitting there in the workshop, thinking about all the above, the
answer came to me slowly but clearly. Because the research processes were made
explicit and studied this way, it allowed us to reason about, find patterns,
and learn from them. We discovered that it didn't really matter as much for the
exercise whether a tool was open or not, but it _was_ useful to know that a
researcher took some data, put it in such and such tool, and that something
came out at the end (of course open tooling makes things so much easier, but we
need to be free to use the right tool for the job). Well, what if we could look
at the research process in a more _functional_ way, with the tools or other
smaller parts of the process as [black boxes][black box] within a bigger
process? It is the _process_ that needs to be open and replicable. _So why are
we not publishing the research process, even across tools, as the fundamental
scholarly output?_ I'm reminded of what the humanist Jeffrey Schnapp says in
[his presentation] on knowledge design, that the process _is_ the product.

If we don't make the process explicit, how will we be able to share, reproduce,
or assess the differences? If we keep the process implicit, or leave it to post
facto analysis alone to attempt to reveal it, we are missing the whole point,
and we end up not very far from where we are now: publishing _about_ the
research, instead of publishing _research_, and our ability to effectively
common will be impeded.

But where do we draw the line between implicit and explicit? Is it enough to
know which tools the researcher used and when? What about the questions and
intentions of the researcher? This is the level at which I think we really need
to be sharing. The researcher's decisions and and the process of how they came
about should form the basis of research publication and collaboration. From
this perspective, the entire research process could be viewed as a sequence of
decisions.

Our process as a committee in defining the Scholarly Commons, aside from the
workshops that we have held, has been mostly limited to seeking feedback when
we were nearing a finished product. Our design process has not been very open,
not because we we haven't wanted it to be open, but because of the lack of
tooling that works this way. We're doing the best we can with what we have, but
we need ways to do this better! [The future _is_ a happy place!][happy place]

In order to create a truly open, collaborative, egalitarian culture of
scholarship, we also need the questions, thoughts, and intentions that were in
the researcher's mind in the first place, _as the knowledge was designed_. We
can't continue publishing only closed forms. We need new forms that [invite
participation][research cases]. We need to publish the _research_. We need to
look at research more at a _cellular_ level (or [_tesseral_ level][vision], if
you will :blush:). If we can find ways to communicate more openly throughout
the process, many of the existing forms of scholarly communications will either
change or go away. The Scholarly Commons should be a jumping-off point to new
ways of working together, taking the best ideas of how to do scholarship in a
modern setting, setting aside as many of the undesirable social, cultural, and
technical limitations as possible.

To explain what I mean by this, allow me to give an example of my experience
working on [the logo] for the Scholarly Commons (which has been backburnered
while we have tried to come to a better understanding of what it is that we are
actually defining). As I went along, I made a conscious effort to explain each
step, question, and resulting decision of the design process. This is the
spirit and culture of the commons! Done this way, the process is open,
transparent, and invites participation. It is easy for anyone to say, 'Did you
think about this or that?' and contribute in context. It is easy for anyone to
get involved in the design process, wherever and whenever the feel they have
something to contribute. Obviously, doing this in a Google Doc is less than
ideal, but I hope you can see what I am trying to show.

# Shared Practice

This to me is the essence of commoning: sharing how, why, and what we do. To do
this, we need a way to explicitly _share_ our practice. I discussed this idea
and the need to share our process openly in the [previous section][the process
is the product]. Taking this idea a step further, we need a way to explicitly
share _patterns_ of practice. Fiona Murphy and Danny Kingsley explored some
possibilities for doing this using [decision trees] during an unworkshop
session. Decision trees put the focus on concrete, actionable things we can do.
Continuing from the [previous quote](#systems-vs-components), Gawande shares
how great the need is to incorporate discoveries into our daily practice:

<figure class="bq grab">

> Nonetheless, in medicine that's exactly what we have done. We have a
> thirty-billion-dollar-a-year National Institutes of Health, which has been a
> remarkable powerhouse of medical discoveries. But we have no National
> Institutes of Health Systems Innovation alongside it studying how best to
> incorporate these discoveries into daily practice...
>
> The same could be said in numerous other fields. We don't study routine
> failures in teaching, in law, in government programs, in the financial
> industry, or elsewhere. We don't look for the patterns of our recurrent

> But we could, and that is the ultimate point.

</figure>

If we can come up with a way to do this in a very general way, this approach
has the potential to make a real difference in how we practice as researchers,
and maybe even blur the line between researchers and practitioners.

# A relative advantage

When it comes down to it, making the transition to this new culture is really a
user experience problem. We need some sort of infrastructure in-between the
tools that will enable this commoning to happen. As much as we've focused on
principles and culture (and they are the driving force in this effort!), we
need an enabling infrastructure for commoning. We need streets for machines for
navigate, so people don't have to. The existing lack of interoperability
between tools is actually an opportunity for something better.

Research zealots will still find ways to blaze trails where there are none, but
why not plan for the city and prepare for the streets to make it easier for
everyone to transition? The tools that are part of the commons should be able
to discover other tools and people and research to interact with, and this
could transform research into a dynamic system rather than the current static
system. Our tools and machines need to know how to common too!

Going back to Everett Rogers' <cite>Diffusion of Innovations</cite>, we need an
advantage over the current system. If we can create a better research
experience, then we have created that advantage. We will then have the
potential to transform the culture!

So building on my [earlier definition] of the Scholarly Commons, but from the
perspective of technology:

<dfn id="def:technology-of-the-scholarly-commons">The Scholarly Commons</dfn>
is an opportunity to transform the culture of scholarship by drastically
improving our practices and widening our networks for the production and flow
of knowledge.

So how do we get there? We're working on a [proposal] for that very purpose.
