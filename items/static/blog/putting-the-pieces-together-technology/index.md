# Components or systems?

One of the topics that pops up every once in a while in our discussions is the
concept of _compliance_. I think this comes from the desire to know where the
boundaries of the Scholarly Commons are, and following that line of thought,
the question of whether or not something belongs within the commons is based
upon whether that thing _complies_ with certain principles of the Scholarly
Commons.

As much as I love and support open-source software and tooling, I think that
this argument has been more of a red herring, missing the whole point of what
the Scholarly Commons is about. Nevertheless, the main track of the workshop
was designed to lead the workshop participants through an exercise of
'compliance checking' common tools to see how well they conformed to the latest
rendition of the principles of the Scholarly Commons.

I think the hope was that, through an empirical approach, we could find a new
system by looking at the old system. But innovation doesn't happen that way. It
usually requires more.

So, in the days leading up to the workshop, I didn't know what the point was of
going through this exercise. We were not going to discover some preexisting
solution that has been waiting for us out there just by looking at all the
components.

Gawande continues from the [previous quote](#systems-vs-components):

> Nonetheless, in medicine that's exactly what we have done. We have a
> thirty-billion-dollar-a-year National Institutes of Health, which has been a
> remarkable powerhouse of medical discoveries. But we have no National
> Institutes of Health Systems Innovation alongside it studying how best to
> incorporate these discoveries into daily practice...

> failures in teaching, in law, in government programs, in the financial
> industry, or elsewhere. We don't look for the patterns of our recurrent
> mistakes or devise and refine potential solutions for them.
>
> But we could, and that is the ultimate point.

# Shared Practice

This to me is the essence of commoning: sharing how, why, and what we do.

We already have shared practice---now we need a way to explicitly _share_ our
practice, and, taking it another step further, to discover and share _patterns_
of practice. Fiona Murphy and Danny Kingsley explored some possibilities for
doing the latter during an unworkshop session.

# TL;DR

The Scholarly Commons is _an opportunity_ to make the world a better place by
drastically improving our practices and widening our networks for the
production and flow of knowledge.
