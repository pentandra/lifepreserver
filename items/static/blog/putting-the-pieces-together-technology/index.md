This post started as a follow-on to a post I am writing about what I learned
about the _culture_ of the Scholarly Commons at the San Diego workshop last
September. But, as it sometimes turns out in this funny thing we call life, it
is time to release this post, and I am still working on the one about culture.
Don't worry---this post is not about specific technologies, but about what
needs to be enabled by technology to allow for _scholarly commoning_.

As this is my own response to the San Diego workshop and to our discovery
process so far relating to the Scholarly Commons, it represents my own views
only, and not necessarily the views of those in FORCE11's Scholarly Commons
Working Group or even its steering committee. Each of us involved in this
project are coming at this from different perspectives, so it is no surprise
that we are not always in complete agreement about what we would like the
Scholarly Commons to be. We are each a product of our own experiences and
backgrounds, and each of our backgrounds is quite dissimilar. Even though this
makes things difficult sometimes, I view this as a good thing. There is a
general consensus among us, I am pretty sure, that the Scholarly Commons is
scholarly communication in a modern setting, one in which we are not
constrained by the limitations of print publishing. But the definition of the
Commons goes much deeper than that, and, as they say, the devil is in the
details. The Scholarly Commons represents scholarship reinvented for our modern
era, and whichever the approach to do that, I am hoping we'll take the best of
the past, the aspirations and thirst for understanding that have motivated
mankind for thousands of years, and redesign the whole system from scratch to
fit our current needs and desires, using whatever existing pieces or
technologies that fit this new way of working, then figuring out how to build
out the rest.

# On gaps and systems

One of the topics that pops up every once in a while lately in the discussions
in the Scholarly Commons working group is the concept of _compliance_. I think
this comes from the desire to understand what the Scholarly Commons is---to
wrap our brains around the idea, and the hope that if we know where the
boundaries of the Scholarly Commons lie, we might be able to reduce the
Scholarly Commons to some transparent explanatory paragraph or set of
principles. Following that type of thinking then, the question of whether or
not something belongs within the commons is based upon whether that thing
_complies_ with certain agreed-upon principles. But the word _compliance_, to
me, conveys more of a heavy-handed, top-down sort of idea, and promotes
exclusivity over inclusivity. I think that for us over the past year this
argument has been more of a distraction that has held us back from discovering
more what the Scholarly Commons is all about. From my viewpoint, the Scholarly
Commons is more about _enabling interactions_ and the _contributions_ that
result from those interactions. We're either commoning or we're not. The things
we're working with either fit together or they don't. A better word for this
type of interactivity might be <dfn id="def:compatibility">compatibility</dfn>,
which, in a telecommunications context, means 'the capability of two or more
items or components of equipment or material to exist or function in the same
system or environment without mutual interference.'[^compatibility] We use and
build upon resources that are compatible with our manner of working. Otherwise,
we just don't use them. They just don't fit. There is no place to put them, and
because of that they don't help, but interfere with progress. Compatibility
puts the focus on fitness for use rather than on obedience, compliance, or even
social expectation.

Notwithstanding all this, the main track of this workshop was designed to lead
participants through an exercise of 'compliance checking' existing tools to see
how well they conformed to the latest rendition of the principles of the
Scholarly Commons.

In the days leading up to the workshop, I struggled to understand the point of
going through such an exercise. The hope was, as far as I could tell, that we
could find a new system by looking at elements of the old system, and filling
in any gaps that we find. But cultural change and innovation don't happen that
way. Besides that, many of the tools that are used for scholarship right now
are based on cultural practices from which we are trying to get away. We were
not going to discover some preexisting solution at this workshop that has been
waiting for us out there just by looking at all the components of the current
system. We need something more. To explain what I mean by this, allow me to
share a similar fallacy and resulting struggle in the practice of medicine:

<figure id="systems-vs-components" class="bq grab">

Research, just like medicine, is not simply a matter of lining up tools into a
usable workflow. We need to approach this problem in a systemic way. The
problem is, we're researchers, and instead of just letting things happen the
way most commons happen, we're trying to be informed by those who have studied
commons, such as Ostrom, Bollier, or Grear, and are attempting to build this
thing, or at least organize it, deliberately. I've often wondered whether or
not this is the right approach, but at least I've been able to find some humor
in it, since what other group of people on this planet besides researchers
would approach solving a problem like this in that way? A member of the SCWG
steering committee has commented that the Scholarly Commons is undertheorized,
and one of the participants of this workshop commented that the Scholarly
Commons is underpracticed. With both I would agree. Much of the time we're
talking hypothetically, and we really don't know how all this will play out in
reality, but I think it is good to act according to the understanding that we
have to invent this thing, let the understanding come from where it may. Even
if we avoid some bumps by studying commoning theory and trying to apply what we
learn, I'm sure we'll still experience enough trial and error throughout the
process to feel that we're doing something good. It doesn't take much current
research practice to come to the conclusion that there must be better ways of
doing things and that critical technologies are currently missing. But why not
try to do this thing? Someone has to figure this out, one way or another.

# The exercise

Putting those concerns aside for a moment, the compliance exercise was very
enlightening for me in some unexpected ways. I need to add here that I did not
participate directly in most of the exercises, but spent most of the day
bobbing between the discussions going on, observing and trying to understand
the participants' various perspectives, so my understanding of some of the
discussions may be incomplete.

  <figcaption class="schema:caption">Some thoughts that emerged during the main track of the workshop, which was slowly whittled down to a few people as discussions diverged, and eventually consisted primarily of [Bj√∂rn Brembs]{lang=nl}, [Jeroen Bosman]{lang=nl}, and [Bianca Kramer]{lang=nl}, on practical pathways toward a scholarly commons using existing tools, organizations, and services.</figcaption>
</figure>

That said, as for my first bit of enlightenment, it was good to talk about
current practices. So much of my time I spend thinking _if we could start over
from scratch, what would the world look like?_ and I don't spend as much time
thinking about the difficulties of transitioning to this new world that others
are facing. For example, one participant was threatened with dismissal from her
doctoral program if she chose to publish a paper open access. And that's just
the resistance placed against the Open Access movement, which has been going on
for many years now. Compared with the Open Access movement, the Scholarly
Commons seems like it is from another millennium. As much as it sounds nice,
and [as happy as it would be to work in this new world][happy place], the
transition to new ways of working together is not going to happen overnight. It
is not enough to know what our destination is---we also need to know how to get
there from where we are now.

Back to the exercise, after the tools went through the 'compliance checking'
activity, they were plotted on a graph, grouped by research phases from the
current publication paradigm. Participants were invited at that point to
describe the path that they would take (if there was one) through these tools
in the course of work in their particular domain of study. The participants
drew their path onto a transparency that was overlaid on top of the tools, and
then these transparencies were grouped by domain...

![A tabletop spread with visual representations (line graphs) of the research
process from several scientific domains.](science_workflows_620x.jpg)

...and then superimposed on top of each other so that common patterns could be
seen. Here are some examples:

![Superimposed scientific workflows](science_workflows_overlaid_620x.jpg)

![Superimposed social science workflows](social_science_workflows_overlaid_620x.jpg)

![Superimposed humanities workflows (many humanists were in the Global South discussion during this exercise)](humanities_workflows_overlaid_620x.jpg)

As you can see, while there is some overlap, the paths, even within domains,
are very idiosyncratic. People are particular about which tools they want to
use, and often there is more than one path to take---more than one tool that
can be used to get a job done. Thinking about it now, certain tools may even be
used to gain a competitive advantage.

Here are a few other thoughts that emerged from the exercise:

* Bad tools are used to perform good things (often requiring some workarounds).
* People use what they use because it works.
* It's way more useful to think of what we are trying to _achieve_ with a tool,
  rather than judging a tool's intrinsic quality of compliance in isolation.
* Tools can actively hinder open if the outputs are not machine-accessible
  using open standards.
* Practice is more important than tools.

Now merging these results with earlier thoughts shared in this essay, it may be
that it is the _commoning_---the practices, not the tools---that needs to be
compliant. Yes, some tools align with practices that we want to carryover into
this new way of working, but looking back, I think if we had kept the
discussion more abstract and focused on specific _practices_ rather than on
tools, we may not have had the eventual disintegration of the main workshop
track as so many of the participants left to join other discussions. Most of
the tools we were studying were designed for the research culture and
infrastructure of the Global North and just [did not connect with many of the
people][april's blog post] that we brought from around the world. Even so, I
did not expect the participants to react this way, and I think this was an
important negative result to obtain and from which we should learn.

Besides the logical fallacy that I described in [the first section][on gaps and
systems], the only thing this exercise showed us is what is common in the
current paradigm, not necessarily what would be required in a commoning
paradigm. The exercise was designed to find _common_ patterns, not patterns of
commoning. Common and commoning are not the same thing, and a common practice
does not a commons make.

# The process is the product

As I was sitting there in the workshop, thinking about all the above, the
answer came to me slowly but clearly. Because the research processes were made
explicit and studied this way, it allowed us to reason about, find patterns,
and learn from them. ~~We discovered that it didn't really matter as much for
the exercise whether a tool was open or not, but it _was_ useful to know that a
researcher took some data, put it in such and such tool, and that something
came out at the end (of course open tooling makes things so much easier, but we
need to be free to use the right tool for the job).~~ The thought occurred
that, well, what if we could look at the research process in more of a
_functional_ way? Isn't it the _process_ that needs to be open and replicable?
_So why are we not publishing the research process, even across tools, as the
fundamental scholarly output?_ If knowledge discovery happens sequentially for
a researcher, _why are we not publishing the journey of the researcher?_ If the
process was the product, many of the problems we are facing right now in
scholarly communications relating to reproducibility, participation, and the
integration of scholarship into society would be greatly diminished or
eliminated completely. Researchers would also have something to show for all
their thinking. The researcher's thoughts and and the process of how they
arrived at conclusions should form the basis of research publication and
collaboration. From this perspective, the entire research process could be
viewed as a sequence of decisions.

If we keep the process implicit, or leave it to post facto analysis alone to
attempt to reveal it, we end up not very far from where we are now: publishing
_about_ the research, instead of publishing _research_, and our ability to
effectively collaborate deeper into the research process will be impeded.

</figure>

But where do we draw the line between implicit and explicit? Is it enough to
know which tools the researcher used and when? The tools are part of it, but
not all. We need to ask ourselves, what is our goal and what is of value in
reaching that goal? If our goal is to create a new culture of scholarship, what
would change the culture?

Our process as a committee in defining the Scholarly Commons, aside from the
workshops that we have held, has been mostly limited to seeking feedback when
we were nearing a finished product. Our design process has not been very open,
not because we we haven't wanted it to be open, but because of the lack of
tooling that works this way. We're doing the best we can with what we have, but
we need ways to do this better! I believe that the future really _is_ a [happy
place]! Throughout this exploration (and it has been a luxury to be able to
explore this topic so intensely for so long), I have tried to be open and learn
from the many perspectives that have contributed to the ongoing definition of
the Commons. I have found it particularly interesting that we have not talked
at all about the definition of _scholarship_ in this process. I think we've
assumed that we're trying to create something for the current professional
community of scholars and researchers. But I think revisiting our definition of
scholarship is a necessary part of defining the Scholarly Commons.

If we go back far enough, say three or four hundred years ago, scholarly
communication didn't happen in the sort of static, dissemination-oriented way
that it does now. People wrote letters to each other, sharing their progress in
understanding openly. It was a collective effort to gain a greater
understanding of the world, one which was empirical and not based on dogma. It
united people across languages, cultures, nationalities, and backgrounds. It
was only later that, for motivations which I think were at odds to the original
intent and mostly based on the economical limitations of print, these letters
were editorialized, and the scholarly article was born. Eventually researchers
submitted articles to the journals directly, and started using publication to
establish scientific priority. You may think that this was a natural evolution,
but I think we lost something in the transition to more 'modern' scholarly
communication. I am reminded of a quote that I've [shared before][research
cases]:

<figure class="bq grab" lang="en-GB">

> While publication and distribution of the Philosophical Transactions
> certainly contributed to the diffusion of knowledge, it did not provide for
> the flexibility, openness, manoeuvrability and relative rapidity of
> interaction that correspondence did. In short, the Society‚Äôs correspondence
> encouraged a more participatory science.

<figcaption>--- Andrea Rusnock, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4028081">Correspondence networks and the Royal Society, <span class="oldstyle">1700--1750</span></a></figcaption>
</figure>

I would argue that what we have lost we need to revive and reintroduce into our
concept and culture of scholarship, and that this idea of '[flexibility,
openness, manoeuvrability, and relative rapidity of interaction]{lang=en-GB}'
is intrinsic in the idea of the Scholarly Commons. We can't have scholarly
commoning unless we open up and expose the research process to this level of
collaboration and participation. Otherwise we're still working in silos, albeit
smaller, distributed ones. We need the spirit of scholarship and enlightenment
that existed in [the Republic of Letters][republic of letters], and it comes
quite naturally if we can stop taking ourselves so seriously.

In order to create a truly open, collaborative, egalitarian culture of
scholarship, we also need the questions, thoughts, and intentions that were in
the researcher's mind in the first place, _as the knowledge was designed_. We
can't continue publishing or disseminating only closed forms. We need new forms
that [invite participation][research cases]. We need to publish the _research_,
exposing it more at the _cellular_ level (or [_tesseral_ level][vision], if you
will :blush:). In order to create this new culture, we need more than open
notebook science, research protocols, or even static depictions of researcher
workflows. All of these things are great, but they don't invite participation
by themselves. We've talked a lot about attribution, but there's something more
to the concept of the researcher that we're not yet talking about that much. We
need something social and dynamic that brings together the pieces of research
and draws people _into_ the process (while, of course, preserving the
attribution, integrity, and openness of the contributions). What about the
questions and intentions of the researcher? This is the level at which I think
we really need to be sharing. If we can find effective ways to communicate more
openly throughout the process, many of the existing forms of scholarly
communications will either change or go away. The Scholarly Commons should be a
jumping-off point to new ways of working together, taking the best ideas of how
to do scholarship in a modern setting, setting aside as many of the undesirable
social, cultural, and technical limitations as possible.

To give an example of what I mean by this, allow me to share my experience
designing [the logo] for the Scholarly Commons. As I went along, I made a
conscious effort to explain each step, impression, question, and resulting
decision of the design process. This is the spirit and culture of the commons!
Done this way, the process is open, transparent, and invites participation. It
is easy for anyone to ask, 'Did you think about this or that?' and contribute
in context. It is easy for anyone to get involved in the design process,
wherever and whenever the feel they have something to contribute. Obviously,
doing this with a Google Doc is less than ideal, but I hope you can see what I
am trying to show.

# Shared Practice

This to me is the essence of commoning: sharing how, why, and what we do. To do
this, we need a way to explicitly _share_ our practice. I discussed this idea
and the need to share our process openly in the [previous section][the process
is the product]. Taking this idea a step further, we need a way to explicitly
share _patterns_ of practice. Fiona Murphy and Danny Kingsley explored some
possibilities for doing this using [decision trees] during an unworkshop
session. Unlike the logical flow of questions that portray a researcher's prior
journey of discovery, decision trees, in this context, describe patterns of
practice (or _behavior_) that can guide the practice of research _going
forward_. Decision trees direct the focus onto concrete, actionable things we
can do.

Of course, the idea with these decision trees is not to mandate specific
research practices, but to create a way to practice and share our patterns of
practice in a collaborative, peer-to-peer sort of way. This vision is painted
beautifully in the foreword to one of my favorite books on typography. Here I
quote, substituting the practice of research or scholarship for the practice of
typography, since what is described could be applied to many types of practices
and we're talking here about the practice of research:

<figure class="bq grab">

</figure>

Instead of writing these rules or guides in prose and sticking them in a book,
leaving it to those who have read the book to carry the torch, or capturing
them in solitary, inert images for people to scan and manually decode, we need
a way for machines to assemble, connect, and semi-automate these guiding
processes. And as more of the researcher's process becomes open, machines will
be free to find patterns among researchers' paths, giving way to some sort of
collective intelligence in a common search for truth.

But we don't need to stop there! Once we have removed barriers to the
production of knowledge, what is to stop us from using this knowledge freely to
improve the lives of everyone!? Continuing from the [previous
quote](#systems-vs-components) which spoke about the focus on components that
has led to a lack of systemic excellence in the practice of medicine, Gawande
provides some direction for the future:

<figure class="bq grab">

> Nonetheless, in medicine that's exactly what we have done. We have a

>
> But we could, and that is the ultimate point.

<figcaption>--- Atul Gawande, <cite>The Checklist Manifesto</cite>, p. [185]{.oldstyle}</figcaption>
</figure>

Decision trees can also be used as an analytical tool to study and refine
practices themselves. This is one of the most promising ideas to me, and is
something that will connect research to practice in a way that simply does not
exist right now. If we can approach this in a very general way, this idea has
the potential to make a real difference in how we practice, not just as
researchers but as practitioners in many other fields, and may even blur the
line between researchers and practitioners.

As much as we've focused on principles and culture (and they are certainly the
driving force in this effort!), we need an enabling infrastructure for
commoning. We need to make the discovery process easier, and enlarge the doors
and allow others to come and participate in this great endeavor! This is part
of the answer to increasing the porosity of the boundaries between knowledge
clubs and allowing others to play easier, more fluidly. Visitors can be guided
to learn the ropes as quickly as possible. The existing lack of
interoperability between tools is actually an opportunity for something better.
The ability to find patterns and assemble these guides, providing a mechanism
to influence and constantly improve practice, is one of the benefits of the
Scholarly Commons over [proprietary approaches], and is something which those
types of approaches will never be able to offer in quite the same way.

# A relative advantage

To summarize, in my view we need technology to help us with two things that are
actually very complementary: we need a way to expose and preserve our own
individual journeys of discovery, and guides to help us through the process.

When it comes down to it, making the transition to this new culture is, in
large part, a user experience problem. Going back to Everett Rogers'
<cite>Diffusion of Innovations</cite>, we need an advantage over the current
system. If we can create a better research experience, one that is open and
invites anyone that desires to come and play and bring what they have to offer,
then we have created an advantage. We will then have the potential and power to
transform the culture.

We also need the ability to try out this new system without worry of losing
what we already have. Rogers refers to this as trialability. The Scholarly
Commons is something that enhances---it does not detract or take away from the
current system, but is an alternative that can exist _alongside_ existing
systems! If you are publishing your process openly, there is nothing to stop
you (or someone else, for that matter) from writing up a summary for a journal,
whether open or proprietary. Either way, the underlying research is still open
for anyone to learn from or build upon. The Scholarly Commons is not anti
anything, but invites all to come and participate. And because of its nature,
the Scholarly Commons, by definition, has the potential to scale bigger in
scope and influence than existing systems are capable.

So even though I'm working on another post about putting the cultural pieces of
the Scholarly Commons together, if I could, at this point, sum up what the
Scholarly Commons is from the perspective of technology, I would say:

<div class="big">

<dfn id="def:technology-of-the-scholarly-commons">The Scholarly Commons</dfn>
is an opportunity to improve the world by drastically improving our practices
relating to the production and use of knowledge.

</div>

So how do we get there? We're working on a [proposal] for that very purpose.
