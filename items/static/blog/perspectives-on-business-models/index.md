To be sustainable, a business must make a profit.

If a business is not sustainable, it is doing a disservice to its clientele,
shareholders, and any other constituencies.

## Paywalling

Companies that paywall access to images or research in the genealogy community
and is no different than what Springer, Elsevier and Wiley do with scholarly
research papers.[^journal-publishers] In saying this I do not intend to
disparage anyone's efforts, only to say that we live in a different world now,
and archaic business models like these stifle collaboration and admission into
the research community. These business models will hopefully become
increasingly unsustainable.

It's not that it doesn't cost businesses to host and disseminate these
images---it's just that copying bits doesn't really provide lasting value to
the customer.[^bits] At least not anymore. In this day and age it's
commoditized and expected to be free. In the <span
class="oldstyle">90</span>'s, [when ancestry.com was
founded](http://corporate.ancestry.com/about-ancestry/company-info/company-history/),
the Internet was a great new thing, and companies could get away with charging
people for access to things. Copies of software were sold, even though the
incremental cost of copying the software was essentially zero.[^buy-software]

I can understand why a business person would choose this model. It's easy and
doesn't require much creativity. It's well established, so doesn't require a
lot of explanation to customers. It provides a stable revenue stream.
_Tempting_...

However, from the customers' perspective, it _kills collaboration_.

Search. Paywalling images[^contract-law] only promotes the siloization of
research, the opposite of collaboration.

Even before this company was officially organized, we were
determined never to use a business model that would tax the inputs or outputs
of the research process. Knowledge needs to freely flow, and anything else
stifles research collaboration.

## Venture Track

An alternative to this that I see happening in a lot of startup is the
noticeable absence of a business model. It is as if the founders couldn't
figure out how to make money with their idea, so the goal is to amass users and
then sell the company to a bigger company that can afford the windfall.

[^bits]: Kevin Kelly has written some interesting essays about this, including
    [Better Than Free](http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/01/better-than-fre/) and
    [Technology Wants To Be Free](http://kk.org/thetechnium/2007/11/technology-want/).

[^buy-software]: This practice continues to this day, but I still consider it a
    relic of the past, and unsustainable.

[^contract-law]: Even though a large percentage of images from commercial image
    providers are in the public domain, from governmental providers, such as
    [NARA](https://www.archives.gov), and are not copyrightable, these
    providers get around this limitation through contract law by requiring new
    users to agree to [certain
    conditions](http://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/termsandconditions) when they
    sign up for an account.
