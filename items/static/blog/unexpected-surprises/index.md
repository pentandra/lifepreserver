I suppose that all surprises are unexpected, but some are even more unexpected
than others. Two weeks ago, we participated in the final round of the
Grow America Springboard Competition. While we didn't win any money, we gained
much through the experience. (To read more about that, you can see [this
post](/blog/ill-take-door-number).)

After we left that day, we reviewed our other options for raising money and
started making plans. Then came an unexpected surprise. Two days after the
competition I received an interesting email. It reminded me of half a dozen
scams where they tell you that you have won some great prize and all you need
to do is share every piece of your personal and financial information in order
to get it.  What I could see of the email without opening it was, "Dear Chris &
Katie Chapman, One of your friends wants to give you a financial..."  I thought,
"Yeah, sure!"  Then I realized it was my business email, where very little
garbage email ends up (knock on wood). I almost deleted it as Spam, but then
decided, "Eh, it can't hurt to at least read the thing." So I clicked it open.

What I found was a message from an organization named [Giving Anonymously].
It said that some friend wanted to give us an anonymous gift and all we needed
to do was reply and confirm that we would accept the gift. Again, I thought to
myself, "Yeah, right!" and almost deleted it. Fortunately, I resisted the
impulse. Instead, I did a Google search for Giving Anonymously and found some
amazing things. Most amazing to me is that they really are for real and they
really do what their name suggests. They serve as the middle-man between an
anonymous giver and the person receiving the gift.

# Gift

Needless to say, we accepted the gift. Even though we had no idea how much
would be coming, we were thrilled to know that someone out there wanted to
support what we are trying to accomplish. We were naturally curious about who
our mysterious benefactor was, why they were sending us money, and how much
they were giving, so we went through the list of everyone we knew or talked to,
but nothing really stuck out. The timing made us wonder if it was someone we
had met at the competition, but really we had no idea. When the mail finally
came, Chris was naturally in a meeting. It took all of my will power to wait
for him to open it with me, but I am glad I did. When we opened the envelope
and saw how generous our benefactor had been, I was honestly in a bit of shock.
Now, the check was not for $10 billion or something obscene, but it was for far
more than I ever imagined someone would be willing to give, without "strings
attached." Even more than that, the amount was almost perfectly what we needed
in order for us to continue driving full steam ahead right now. The amazing
connection between our need and their gift felt like perfect serendipity---my
miracle.

We were grateful for the financial support, but the note that came attached to
the check is at least as valuable to us. I would like to share some of it with
you:

# Gratitude

Giving Anonymously also provides a way for the gift recipients to record a
thank you message for the giver. I was afraid that I would lose all ability to
talk through my tears of gratitude as I left my meager message. It was a moment
when words could not have possibly conveyed the full impact of the experience
or hold a candle to how vibrant my emotions of gratitude and awe felt inside of
me. In part, that is why I decided to write this post---I wanted to make sure
that whoever did this for us, knows how truly and fully grateful we are. We are
grateful for the financial support and perhaps even more grateful for the
mental support that encourages us to keep pushing forward.

So, if you are out there, whoever you are, please accept my gratitude and
thanks.
