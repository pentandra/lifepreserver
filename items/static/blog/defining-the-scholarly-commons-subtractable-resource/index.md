My thoughts on this, which are consistent with commons theory and are touched
upon in [a blog post by Bruce Caron][collectives], is that a scholarly commons
will form because of a need---a need for understanding. People that actually
care about a certain knowledge will collect around a need to understand and a
desire to care for and further that knowledge in order to satiate that need for
understanding. This collective is the seed of a commons. Discussions will ensue
that will establish rules, traditions, and values pertaining to how to deal
with the shared resources of the commons, which will include the active and
latent knowledge of that field of study. The subtractable resource around which
a scholarly commons forms is the moments of discovery that reveal, bit by bit,
the latent knowledge within that field of study. Once a contribution is made,
it cannot be made again in quite the same way, and once a new understanding is
revealed to a collective, it cannot be discovered to that collective anew.
Scholarly commons (plural) can form around any type of knowledge. A scholarly
commons can be nested within another, either imitating the structure of the
knowledge around which it was created, or more likely, around the type of need
it is trying to fill. But whatever the structure of these commons, we need a
standard technical mechanism to tie them together, so that they are mutually
interoperable and beneficial.
