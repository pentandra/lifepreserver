Last week I had the opportunity to participate in the second workshop of the
Defining the Scholarly Commons project (I covered the first workshop in <%=
link_to('an earlier blog posting', '/blog/reimagining-research-communications/',
title: 'Pentandra Blog → Reimagining Research Communications') %>).
As you can tell from the squiggly line above, our course has not been straight,
neither has it been smooth sailing. We have learned a lot, however, and even
made some progress in the meantime.

<!--MORE-->

For our steering committee, this workshop was one we have been truly
anticipating, the culmination of a lot of thought and discussion of some very
fundamental matters. As can be expected, many of us embarked upon this project
from different places and with different expectations, and it seems that all of
our diverse streams of thought converged on the inputs and outputs of this one
workshop. It was good that the workshop was held on the top floor of a
fifteen-story building, with many windows, plenty of fresh air, and a nice
balcony upon which to exercise [the law of two feet].

During this workshop there was a main track that was needed to fulfill some of
the original Helmsley grant requirements, which [Jeroen Bosman]{lang=nl} and
[Bianca Kramer]{lang=nl} expertly designed to fit the theme of _putting the
pieces together_. At many points in the program, participants also had the
opportunity to propose or join an unworkshop session to discuss any related
topic or perspective that they desired. Despite a somewhat rocky beginning, I
am happy that people were able to share and participate in what mattered to
them. I tried to bounce around these unworkshops and the main track, learning
as much as I could. Good conversations were taking place at all of them! But
there were a few themes that I have been mulling, and questions for which I
have been trying to find answers, that I want to explore further and discuss a
bit in this post.

# A _global_ commons?

One unworkshop that especially stood out to me, and apparently to [many other
workshop attendees][april], was a workshop led by [Ravi Murugesan][ravi] about
_incorporating scholarly attitudes from the Global South to develop the
commons_. Since I have never lived in the Global South and I've never worked as
an institutional researcher, I have a lot to learn about the challenges that
professional researchers face day-by-day around the world. It was an
wonderfully mind-opening experience for me. I found out that there is a lot of
leftover cruft from the colonialization of the world over the past couple
hundred years by various cultures (mostly by the more developed countries of
the [Global North]), and the effects of these experiences still linger and
extend deeply into the researcher's life at the academy. Many are resentful and
feel like the North/West is trying to push their own ways of doing things upon
others, without them having a say in what is going on. For many researchers in
the South, institutional funding is given predominantly to solve local
problems, yet the ultimate prize is to have an article published in a northern
journal. All this imbalance and inequity has lead to serious pressures and real
problems for researchers of all kinds.

Several of us on the steering committee thought it was a cool coincidence that
these first two workshops has been Spanish themed. We started in Madrid, and
now we're in San Diego, and were able to use the colors of each city flag in
designing the workshop logos, and it just worked. But looking at [the map
above](#fig:journey-of-defining) from more of an _evil_ point of view, our
journey from Madrid to San Diego could be thought of as a journey of
_conquest_. Isn't this the same path that [Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo][cabrillo]
and [others][vizcaino] took as they claimed land for Spain? Obviously, this is
not what we have in mind. The difference is that we are not
[conquistadores]{lang=es} and we are not trying to create an
[[encomienda]{lang=es}][encomienda] system[^citizen_science] here! In fact, the
struggles and inequities of the current system are the very things from which
we are trying to get away. I think there's a lesson from history here from
which we should learn---and things we should not repeat. Groundbreaking
opportunities exist to try to do things a different way. We have a chance to do
something good here, and it is critical that we do it right.

[I want to put forward here an alternative approach]{.newthought} to explaining
where I think we are right now by comparing our situation with a few
experiences of several early groups that encountered challenges similar in
principle to what we're facing at this time. Maybe it's that Cameron Neylon has
me [thinking about groups][groups] lately, but these particular groups stick
out in history to me[^disclaimer] because of their unique accomplishments and
the effects of their shared culture despite the fact that they came together
from such distinctly divergent backgrounds and points of view.

What we're trying to accomplish with the Scholarly Commons has some striking
similarities to what we know of the circumstances surrounding the venture of
the [Plymouth Colony] and specifically the signing of the [Mayflower Compact].
As I contemplate where we are with the Scholarly Commons, I see this early
venture with new eyes. I see groups of people with significant differences (in
the colonists' case significant religious differences, in our case the
differences are more diverse) coming together for a common purpose. They had
the opportunity to leave it all---to run away from their differences, but they
chose not to.

First for some background. Two groups were on board the Mayflower: those who
commissioned the ship, and those who were commissioned to manage the ship and
help setup a colony (the crew). According to language of the former (who kept
the only records we have of this experience), these two groups were referred to
respectively as the Saints and the Strangers. (These labels may give some
insight into the obvious tensions between the two groups.) Unlike most of their
contemporaries headed to the New World, these colonists were not entrepreneurs
or [conquistadores]{lang=es} determined to conquer indigenous peoples, but came
seeking freedom to practice religion the way they believed. This difference
obviously changed how they approached problems, and with much patience and
determination they were able to develop relationships of trust and mutual
respect with each other as well as with the indigenous tribes of the New
World.[^massasoit] They learned from each other. They helped each other. Their
circumstances were not perfect, nor was every choice that was made. People
goofed up on both sides. But they kept trying, got some things right, and they
did something that had never been done before. They showed the world that what
they set out to achieve was possible. Their achievements changed the perception
of many, and led to their eventual success as a colony. Together they created a
new kind of society---a shared culture---that had such an impact on the early
culture of the United States that we still celebrate this time of our history
during our [Thanksgiving holiday][thanksgiving].

## An agreement to unite

After setting off for the New World, this group encountered difficulties that
pushed their arrival later than anticipated and with not enough supplies to
finish the voyage to Virginia. They decided it would be prudent to stop
earlier, off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Because they would not be
headed to their previously agreed-upon destination, Virginia, several of the
passengers and crew said that the original charter was null and void, and that
they "would use their own liberty; for none had power to command
them."[^bradford] They were wanting to go at it in the new place on their own,
every man for himself. Others, in what I see as a moment of inspiration,
thought it would be better to cooperate and help each other, especially as they
arrived in this cold place in late November. They drafted a compact that they
hoped everyone would agree to and sign before they left the ship. Thankfully,
and after some persuasion, they all consented to sign for the sake of order and
survival. I like to think that they also may have signed to take advantage of
an opportunity to do something that very few of their Old World predecessors
had ever had the opportunity to do: deliberately coming together and _creating
their own government_.

<figure id="fig:the-mayflower-compact" class="img" property="schema:sharedContent" typeof="schema:ImageObject">
  <img alt="Passengers of the Mayflower signing the 'Mayflower Compact' including Carver, Winston, Alden, Myles Standish, Howland, Bradford, Allerton, and Fuller." src="The_Mayflower_Compact.jpg" />
  <figcaption>The depiction in <i property="schema:title">Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620</i>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Leon_Gerome_Ferris">Jean Leon Gerome Ferris</a>, resembles the journey we have undertaken to converge upon the principles of the Scholarly Commons.</figcaption>
</figure>

The compact was simple enough. They covenanted to "combine \[them\]selves
together into a civil body politic; for better ordering, and preservation and
furtherance of the ends aforesaid". These ends aforesaid, or the goals
previously mentioned, were to undertake a voyage and to plant a new colony.
They then made provision for the creation of laws "from time to time, as shall
be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony", and
agreed to abide by the laws that would be created.[^cultural-affordances]

The agreement to deliberately come together and unite instead of doing it all
separately and individually (or just letting whatever happen), was such a
simple thing, yet so far-reaching in its consequences. They didn't worry at
that point about deciding on specifics such as laws; those details could be
worked out later as the need arose. With the possibility of mutiny hanging over
their heads, these two groups effectively said on that cold November day in New
England: _for our own survival, we need to be and to move forward together_. A
brilliant example of self-organization to meet a critical need.[^rough-winter]

## A clash of cultures

The next spring, the colonists had the opportunity to enter into an agreement
with a group from another culture: Massasoit, the well-respected leader of the
Wampanoag Indian tribe. 

Squanto and his friend.

## A new land of opportunity

{::comment}
Now what we're doing here is not religious in nature, but I do see similarities
in the motivations and desires between the two experiences. Many are stuck in a
system where they don't have freedom to practice they way they would like to.
In saying this, I'm not trying to say that being able to publish something open
access is as important as the free practice of religion, or that professional
researchers have suffered as much as those early Christians, or that I'm trying
to cast people into stereotypes, which I'm not.
{:/comment}

Now, as April Hathcock has [so nicely articulated][april], we need _real
conversation_ to take place to take advantage of this opportunity. We need to
learn from each other, the North from the South, the West from the East, and
vice versa. This can't be a colonialization of the world by the Global North.
This would be an epic failure. The Scholarly Commons needs to be rather a
[_colonization_][colonization] of _a new land of shared practice_ by people
from all parts of the world, nations, cultures, and languages, that are willing
to say that we can do better, and we will do it together. It is a space where
we can bring together the best of our cultures. We need the widespread open
culture of the South (which is exemplified in efforts such as [SciELO]). We
need to leave behind the ego or prestige culture of the North. It may be that
the North has further to travel, and that the South may not have as far to go.
Whichever way you see it, we need to continue these conversations. The fact
that these conversations are happening at all is a good thing. We're all coming
at this from where we are. But is there any other place from which we _could_
come? I see these conversations, however uncomfortable, candid, or mind-blowing
as the beginning of the commons! They have to happen, and the important thing
is that we create a culture of learning: that we're willing to learn and grow
and change as we go. This new land that we have embarked upon is full of ripe
possibility. What is important is that we commit to come together to do
something greater than any of us, and that we involve as many voices as would
like to be heard so we can create something well-rounded and balanced. We need
something that everyone can touch.

# Our great decision

We also face a critical decision at this point in time. Our choice is not about
winter survival in a cold bay in New England, but the Scholarly Commons _could
be thought of_ as a new land or frontier, a place that we don't fully
understand yet, but full of promise and potential. There is certainly a need
for _better ordering_ and _preservation_, and plenty of _ends aforesaid_. We
may ask ourselves, what's wrong with just going at this on our own? There is so
much potential out there, and people and organizations are already staking out
their ground! Why not just let things go as they have done up to this point in
time, and hope that it all works out? Isn't the <span
lang="fr">laissez-faire</span> approach good enough? It has gotten us here,
hasn't it!? _Why is it so important that we do this together?_

Quite frankly, I don't think any of our current approaches have had the power
to transform the current systems of scholarship. We need something more,
something that is so amazing that it would transform the world, something that
others will see and say, "That's awesome! Why don't we work like that?" I think
of the words of Alexander Hamilton in discussing the need for a new
constitution for the same region, more than <span class="oldstyle">160</span>
years after the initial compact was signed on board the Mayflower, describing a
situation eerily similar to that earlier time, just on a much bigger scale.

</figure>

Now a scholarly commons is not a civil body, it's a commons---a middle ground
somewhere between the grassroots level of people and the institutions of
state.[^commons] A commons has no prescribed structure; it is whatever the
people decide for it to be. It is a coming together of people for some greater
purpose. In our case, the greater purpose is _the
contributions_[^contributions] that further our understanding of who we are,
the world, and everything else associated. The great decision we collectively
face is whether to come together and establish a commons for scholarly and
scientific research, or to continue doing things the way they have been done
for so long, having some vague hope for positive change. We need to decide by
our conduct and example whether societies of researchers are really capable or
not of establishing good governance from reflection and choice, or whether we
are forever destined to depend for their scholarly communications on accident
and market forces. Without that choice, there is no Scholarly Commons nor
indeed can there be, or at least not anything that will bring together and
unite the researchers of the world in such a way.

[I see here an opportunity to do something]{.newthought} that has never been
done before---something that would improve the lives of everyone, and to do it
for the right reasons. The Scholarly Commons will not only give more freedom to
the professional researchers, but will open up opportunities for many more
people to become involved in knowledge work, and make knowledge itself more
free and abundant.

<figcaption>--- Thomas Jefferson</figcaption>
</figure>

I see the Scholarly Commons as one of the most wonderful opportunities that has
ever presented itself to mankind. So much of what happens in our world is based
upon the knowledge that is available, and if we can remove barriers to that
knowledge, and open up the ability for people to interact with it more freely,
it would disrupt the world and further _so many other important initiatives_.
For all the good intentions of those of earlier times, they never had the
technology to pull off something like a global commons of researchers, sharing
as they go, almost instantaneously, the collective research of the world, ever
expanding. Thinking more about it, though, isn't this what [the Web was
originally intended][heading to oai8] to accomplish?

# How can it be done?

I'm going to step forward through time and back down to reality for a minute,
and face this question of diversity. Our diversity is an opportunity but it is
also a challenge. We are all spread around the globe and don't have the luxury
of being stuck together in the cabin of a ship with the exigency of making a
decision and the determination to not set foot on shore before doing so. And,
tomorrow, when it comes down to it, most of us have to do whatever our
higher-ups tell us to do! How do we develop the capacity and urgency to make
this choice in some sort of collective, unified way?

Since we can't stop the world while we answer these questions, we need leaders
who have made the initial decision to come together and move forward, and have
the vision, patience, and determination to find answers and make the needed
changes a little bit at a time. Danny Kingsley brought up [the theory of the
diffusion of innovations][diffusion], or how innovations permeate society, and
in this I think we can find some clues as to how we move forward. There are
communities that are ready to work in new ways. We need to find these early
adopters and experiment with new ways of working together.

The Scholarly Commons is a _culture_ of the same sort as the culture of Open,
or the spirit of freedom. It is not a software platform any more than GitHub is
the Open Source Software culture. The Scholarly Commons will need software with
new types of interactions---those that open up the process of research and
bring people together in more egalitarian ways. The more aligned the software
is with this culture, the less people will find fault with it.

## The necessity of a *counter*culture

Using the language of Christopher Alexander's book <cite>[Notes on the
Synthesis of Form]</cite>, this problem could be viewed as a problem of
_fitness_. The old form that [Henry Oldenburg designed][PhilTrans venture] has
outlived its purpose, and does not fit the needs of our situation anymore. We
need a new form or _culture_ of scholarship that fits the current context.

However, according to Alexander, we cannot see the context to which we are
trying to fit a new form, except for when the new form doesn't fit. We don't
notice stuff that is right, we just see things that don't fit because they
clash. So how can we _consciously_ design a new form that fits an invisible
context which is so complex that we can't fully wrap our brains around it, even
if we could see it?

I don't see this as a mutinous rebellion, and I'm not advocating a mass
uprising against the institutional powers-that-be. We don't want every
researcher to quit their job or go on strike. What we need is a better
alternative---a counterculture that people will find and to which they can
align themselves as they are ready. We need a sandbox that will allow these new
[patterns] and forms to be discovered and safely evolve without the risk of
disruption or abolition by the hegemonies of the current
system.

Going forward, there needs to be an emphasis on practice. We have gathered all
of these great ideas, and spent a lot of time distilling principles, but we
need to show what scholarly commoning looks like. We need mechanisms for
participating commoners to govern themselves, and principles flexible enough
for anyone to repurpose or modify to fit a particular need, so that commoning
is co-created from practice, rather than being a set of principles that we try
to _fit_ into an existing situation.

If it looks the same and feels the same, then what have we changed? We have to
stand for something.

In making this argument, I'm making a few assumptions. The first is that more
knowledge and understanding is a good thing. The second is that sharing is
better than not sharing. Sharing is good because it creates new knowledge
(which is good according to my first assumption).

I think that we need a broader strategy, and a more holistic and inclusive
approach to building a commons. We've focused institutionally so far, and
rightly so. This is where it needs to start. But I think going forward we need
to think more broadly, and reconsider the academy in a bigger context, with the
end goals and needs of a much more diverse population in mind. We need a
commons for the people, not for the institutions.

## The scholar-commoner

This is where, at least to me, we come to the heart of what the Scholarly
Commons is. While technology, efficiency, and all these social and cultural
aspects are important, they are very abstract, high-level, and don't reach what
I think the core of the Scholarly Commons is all about. The Scholarly Commons
is about people---<em>changed</em> people. The change that we are hoping for
must start inside the heart and mind of each individual.

We need a new kind of researcher. The current stereotype paints a researcher as
aloof, caring only about himself and his next grant application. Researchers
don't share because they're afraid of being scooped. This parallels the
depiction of the <i>rational man</i> by economists as a self-interested person
that only cares about his own gain. This is the man upon which Garrett Hardin
based the <cite>[Tragedy of the Commons]</cite>.

This new kind of researcher is one that is human, and willing to work outside
of these stereotypes. One that cares about humanity.

The Scholarly Commons is an opportunity to forgive, move forward, and overcome
the effects of colonialism. Greed vs

If we took away the current incentives, why would anyone do it?

# TL;DR

So this essay started out as an assignment to write my thoughts in less than
[400]{.oldstyle} words as to what the Scholarly Commons _is_ and the direction
that we go next for the principles. If you've made it this far in this post,
you have realized how far I have failed. But if I was to sum up my thoughts
into a very high-level statement of what the Scholarly Commons is, here's what
I would say:

<div class="big">

<dfn id="def:the-scholarly-commons">The Scholarly Commons</dfn> is the
opportunity to come together and create a new culture of commoning on scholarly
and scientific knowledge.

</div>

Bear in mind that these are my own thoughts, and do not necessarily represent
the thoughts of our group. See this for some more perspectives.

As for the direction to go next with the principles, I think we need to create
ways to preserve and continue these conversations. We need to find ways to
broaden the conversations, and to invite more diverse groups to take part in
them. Then we need to take what we discover and put it into practice, thereby
creating scholarly and scientific commons for the good of all mankind.

[^citizen_science]:

    Actually I've been thinking more and more that the term _citizen science_
    doesn't go far enough, and sometimes I worry that the practice ends up
    resembling an [[encomienda]{lang=es}][encomienda] system more than I would
    like.

[^bradford]:

    These quotations from the Mayflower Compact and other circumstances
    relating to these early colonists can be found on [the Wikipedia
    page][Mayflower Compact] (with spelling modernized), or in [Bradford's
    History "Of [Plimoth]{.sic} Plantation"](http://archive.org/stream/historyplymouth01socigoog#page/n246/mode/2up),
    Book [2]{.oldstyle} [Anno]{.sic} [1620]{.oldstyle}, written by William
    Bradford in the years from [1630]{.oldstyle} to [1651]{.oldstyle}, and
    printed in entirety for the first time in [1854]{.oldstyle}.

[^cultural-affordances]:

    In a footnote of a later edition of Bradford's history, a quotation from
    Gardiner's <cite>History of England</cite>, [1603--1642, [IV]{.roman}.
    163]{.oldstyle} is particularly relevant to the analogy I am making here
    with the Scholarly Commons:

    <div class="bq grab" lang="en-GB">

    My point here does not have to do with North versus South or America versus
    Europe _per se_, and is certainly not meant to disparage or make light of
    any persons or groups from our collective past, but only to say that some
    colonies were created not to establish dominion over other peoples, but for
    higher, nobler motivations, for example: to escape the injustices or
    tyrannies of an incumbent system. So from this point of view, the Scholarly
    Commons is about a [_culture of open_][open], and about the _affordance_
    that that new culture and sociality provides. The Scholarly Commons is a
    new sociality or culture distinct from the traditional culture of
    scholarship in much the same way that America was separate and distinct
    from the social and political world of England.

[^commons]:

    Here's a recent video [from David Bollier and Anna Grear][new-video] that
    explains why commons are so important, especially for the global problems
    that we now face:

    </video>

[^contributions]:

    I'm thinking of contributions here in a broader sense: the social and
    cultural processes of creating knowledge and sharing it with others, not
    just technical resources.

[^massasoit]: 

    Before preparing this essay, I did not realize how fortunate these people
    were in landing where they did, when they did.

    The Plymouth colonists show this determination to bridge differences with
    courage and their great fortune later on in their treaty with [Massasoit],
    the great chief of the Wampanoag Indians, on March [22]{.oldstyle} the next
    year.

[^disclaimer]:

    I would not be surprised to learn that similar stories of disparate groups
    coming together are found in the histories of many cultures around the
    world, though I am biased and love the stories of the founding of the
    United States. I picked these specific examples from history because they
    are familiar to me (I knew about them), and they seemed to fit my
    conception of the Scholarly Commons as a break from the old ways: something
    completely new, not an incremental redesign of our current system of
    scholarly communication.

[^rough-winter]:

    And it was good they did this too, because they needed everyone that was
    able to help to make it through that first winter. More than half of the
    colonists died that winter, and the rest needed that unity to survive.
