Inclusivity is not an intrinsic quality of the Scholarly Commons---it is a just
a side-effect (albeit a welcoming one) of how we treat the [subtractable
resources] around which scholarly commons are based. The need for participation
and the willingness to common together on the subtractable resources---the
moments of discovery---as they happen instead of keeping these discoveries
private until publication is what differentiates the Scholarly Commons from the
current system. We cannot separate the specific approaches to and types of
technology or business models that are needed to support this kind of culture
from the culture itself---they are, by definition, part of it. The culture
cannot exist without them. Can you imagine the OSS culture without the
Internet? or without distributed source code management systems, such as `git`?
The technologies allow these cultures to exist. ~~This is in harmony with
Cultural Science, in that these technologies are the _knowledge_ around which
groups form.~~

The Scholarly Commons is more about the scholarly and scientific knowledge than
it is about the current players---not that the current players don't matter,
but that the underlying purposes and motivations for this work---the
discoveries that will bless all of mankind and the commoning processes that
support them---are bigger than any one player, to which no one player or group
of players may lay claim.

While legislation and academic policies do need to be changed to incentivize
participation and value these broader contributions, researchers from remote
locales of the world, such as Tripura, India or Thai Nguyen, Vietnam, [will
have many more opportunities than they currently have][ravi's second post] to
participate and be heard.
