We need a shared vision that can help us know how to
get from where we are now to where we want to be. Once we have that
vision we can start working towards it over time, as you have said. This
is a culture shift, though a shift that has been pointed to many many
declarations and manifestos over the years. It opens up a completely new
(or old, depending on how you look at it) mindset for why we
communicate. And as Ivar pointed out, the evolution of culture is
inseparable from the evolution of technology, so it would follow that if
we shift the culture, the technology will also shift, or will be used
within a different context or frame of reference or at least with
different motivations. It won't happen all at once. And once we know
where we want to go, we'll need a path to get from here to there.

We are not alone in thinking these things. [Bonaventure Mvé-Ondo]{lang=ewo}, in
his book <cite>[Africa: The Scientific Divide][scientific divide]</cite>, calls
for a modern renaissance which encompasses a completely new culture and
approach to science. One statement he makes in particular hints at the
direction of this transformation: "The whole question, then, is how to move
from a Westernization of science to a truly shared science, undergirded by a
'multiplicity of epistemologies'."[^bonaventure] The Scholarly Commons, as a
convergence into "a truly shared science", will likely not result in one
universal or one-size-fits-all technical solution, but should lead to the
condition that we can work together effectively across a "multiplicity of
epistemologies" without it being rigid or confining.

Whatever the structure of these commons, we need a standard technical mechanism
to tie them together, so that they are mutually interoperable and beneficial.
