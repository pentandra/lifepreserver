In this essay, I will discuss a framework for describing the extremely complex
resource that we call _knowledge_, starting with the work of Charlotte Hess and
Elinor Ostrom, including several conflated concepts that have even seeped into
our own discussions. I will then take this framework further and bring in the
idea of _potential and prior discoveries_.

I want to talk about the commons and enclosures of the commons in a way that
goes beyond the stereotypical commons versus market and state debate. Or maybe
not too far beyond if you consider the publish-or-perish environment of the
current system not too different from the competitive pressures of a predatory
market. I want to talk about researchers as privateers and exploiters of
knowledge discovery, and how this mindset and logic originated with the journal
and is antithetical to the culture of the Scholarly Commons.

A constellation of logic:

1. We are all individuals in our own unique context, with our own unique
   perspectives, and our own unique contributions to make.
2. In the Republic of Letters, people were more apt to share and common on the
   knowledge discovery. People wrote and read letters, but it felt more like a
   group effort. Ideas were assimilated and scientific priority was not as
   established. People didn't worry about scooping.
3. The transition to the journal article privitized research contributions
   (even before the journals became private) and established scientific
   priority on the level of the written article. They didn't know how to deal
   with the attribution! It was easier to privitize, because then you could
   keep the contributions intact. People don't share with each other because
   they are worried about scooping and don't want to have to worry about adding
   people as co-authors and other complex and awkward attribution schemes. But
   it still doesn't work---it has lead to hiding of the research process and of
   realistic attribution. Differences in opinion were expressed by publishing
   papers with opposing viewpoints. Reconciliations were often implicit and
   disconnected.
4. In the industrialization of science is an outcropping of this mentality. has
   made the motivations more perverse especially after the grant money has been
   awarded. and reinforced the privitization because it is more awkward to
   bring collaborators in after a grant has been awarded.
5. Scholarly commons make it possible for individuals to work together and
   cultivate the same field while maintaining individuality. We need the
   individuals---there is no commons without the commoners.

The value is in the research, not in the fancy words she put together to
impress a bunch of academics. Writing it up didn't make her discovery any more
impressive. ---Katie

# Information as a common-pool resource

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I do not think that the central
resource of a scholarly commons are articles or papers, in fact, I do not think
that it is digital at all. I don't think that is what people "common" around. I
don't even think a collaborative writing process is what the Scholarly Commons
is about. While there are good things about Open Access and Creative Commons,
and there is definite benefit to the dissemination of knowledge that happens
when papers or any information is open for people to download and read, these
things as they are now are not enough to create a complete system of scholarly
commoning.

> how to employ a worthless time-consuming hypothesis. Freeing his time for its
> more effective exploratory investment is to give man increased wealth.

# The nature of discoveries

The subtractable resource around which a scholarly commons forms is the moments
of discovery that reveal, bit by bit, the latent knowledge within that field of
study. In this definition, I'm using the term <dfn>discovery</dfn> very loosely
here to mean any new insight or understanding to the collective that aids in
further discovery. A discovery could be the enlightening answer to a
long-standing research question that changes our understanding of how the world
works. A discovery could also be something as subtle as finding the right
question to ask. I'm also separating the discovery from the knowledge that has
been discovered. The discovery---that enlightening moment of [eureka!]---is the
subtractable resource of the Scholarly Commons, and can be catalogued as such,
as it happened in some moment of time and will never happen again. It can be
subtracted from the set of all potential discoveries that remain within that
field of study. The knowledge that was revealed by that discovery, however, is
set free, for example, to become public.

Ocean waves provide a more tangible illustration of this type of subtractable
resource. Even though it seems like there will be no end to the waves that
pummel the beach incessantly, each wave is unique and unrepeatable. Each wave
is the arithmetical result of a complex set of forces that have acted together
to produce its precise form of expression. Once one of these waves comes and
goes, it will never come again. In some locations, these waves are guarded and
protected, like in [the surfing commons off the Banzai Pipeline beach][surfing
commons], where rules describing how to use these scarce resources must be
followed if you want to play. There are just not enough waves to go around, and
surfers want to make the most of them when they happen. In a scholarly commons,
like the waves of the sea, these moments of discovery are a scarce resource.
Once a contribution is made, it cannot be made again in quite the same way.
Once a new understanding is revealed to a collective, it cannot be discovered
to that collective anew.

If the moments of discovery are the subtractable resource of the commons, what
is being done with these resources right now? Surely they still exist, but they
are being privatized by researchers who lay claim to the ground, thinking of it
as their own exclusive property, hoping that others will not stumble onto their
territory before they have fully harvested, processed, and packaged the new
knowledge for resale. Perhaps this is a pessimistic perception, but why else
would researchers not share what they're working on but for fear of being
scooped?

The culture of the commons views things differently. Discoveries are still your
own, but there is no reason to hide your research from others. In actuality, it
is much more likely that the opposite is happening. There is every reason to go
out and *proclaim* the ground that you see so that other people can build on
top of it---not just for your own sake, but for the sake of everyone else in
the world that could be using your contribution right now. If your whole
process is open for everyone to see, there is not the fear of others taking
something away from you or claiming they have discovered something before you,
but a trust that others will come to help uncover that which was before hidden.

Though these contributions are smaller and more fine-grained, they are not
half-baked. Each contribution is identifiable universally and independent in
its own sphere of influence, the only barrier of entry being access to the
Internet and an ability to contribute in some way. Participating in the
Scholarly Commons comes with more of a sense of immediate gratification, more
opportunities of service, and many more ways to contribute.

And just as the surfing commons is not as much about managing the _water_ as it
is about managing the _waves_, if the subtractable resource of scholarly
commons is really the discoveries, then the Scholarly Commons is not as much
about _managing the outputs of research at every stage of the research process_
as it is about managing the _process of discovery_. If we can understand the
implications of this subtle difference, it will change our entire understanding
of what the Scholarly Commons is, as well as direct our approach to defining
it. This understanding makes the Scholarly Commons much more of a game changer
than many of us are currently imagining. It is not as much about the flow of
scholarly objects---the Scholarly Commons changes the nature of the hunt. The
Scholarly Commons _exposes the subtractability of discoveries in a more
efficient way_ than does the current system, meaning that opportunity exists
that did not exist before, for anyone who desires to play, to participate
openly in the unfolding of discoveries. Discoveries will happen in the open,
for anyone to to watch unfold in realtime, unlike how they happen now:
privately, behind closed doors, and we only hearing about them later on. If we
approach the definition of the Scholarly Commons in this way, it will
accelerate research in an unprecedented way, distribute power from the hands of
a few to the hands of many, and ultimately will be of much greater benefit to
mankind.
