For more than twenty years, or at least ever since the World Wide Web enabled
new possibilities for sharing knowledge, there has been a general discontent
among many with the ways scholarly and scientific knowledge is shared.
Researchers freely give the results of their research (in the form of papers)
to publishers, the publishers enlist other researchers without compensation to
review these papers, and then the publishers turn around and sell expensive
subscriptions to these papers to research libraries and to the public for
$30--40 apiece. Researchers who realize what is going on feel trapped by a need
to keep things to themselves until publication for fear of being scooped and to
publish in the most prestigious (and often most expensive) journals in order to
keep their jobs. Other researchers are either not aware of these problems or
turn a blind eye to them because they think this is just how the system works
and there is nothing that they can do to change it.

Over the years, impassioned researchers have led resistance movements of
various kinds, including [boycotts of certain publishers][boycotts]. Many of
these approaches have been successful at raising awareness and support for the
cause, but they have not led to any real change of the system as a whole. By
pointing out these things, my intention is not to discount those efforts or to
bash publishers in general. Many publishers play a critical part in the
functioning of the current system and feel just as trapped by their position in
it. We all need something better. We need something that will provide a cure
for the inequities of current systems of scholarship and science that take
unfair advantage of the researchers and the public and often leave critical
information, sometimes needed in life and death situations, unavailable to
those who need it the most. It doesn't have to be that way.

R. Buckminster Fuller has said that "to change something, build a new model
that makes the existing model obsolete." So a couple years ago [some of us got
together][scwg] to define an alternative system, which we are calling the
Scholarly Commons. We are engaged in a battle to open up the knowledge of the
world---to build bridges between society and the type of knowledge that is
currently being held behind paywalls or [trapped in researchers' minds][opening
knowledge]. The walls of the old system are cracking and there are holes in
some places, but we need a viable alternative before people will feel
comfortable enough to venture into new territory. We are trying to define an
alternative system that would allow anyone the ability to access and
participate in science and scholarship.

In order to draw some comparisons, I am using a piece of early street art made
by [Thierry Noir]{lang=fr} in protest of the Berlin Wall [as the
mascot](#the-key-to-success) of this post, even though it is not his [most
well-known work][mutations] and tearing down a wall is not enough. In a sense,
the painting of the Berlin Wall during the 1980s is representative of the
modern-day resistance movement in scholarly communications that has led to the
situation in which we now find ourselves. In the minds of the people at that
time, the act of painting the Berlin Wall created an alternative way of looking
at and thinking about the Wall, an alternative system so to speak. It changed
the Wall from a "killing machine" to something that could be transcended, if
only in thought. It threw out the assumption that the Wall was unapproachable
and proved that it was possible _to think_ about it and the more sublime
revelation that there might be more than one way to think about it.

The Scholarly Commons provides us an similar opportunity to step back and
deeply consider the direction we want to go with science and scholarship. While
it is in part a reaction to the inequities of the current system, the Scholarly
Commons is also a new mindset---not one of naivete or innocence, but one that
leverages our collective understanding of the past to help us avoid the all too
familiar mind traps and rabbit holes as we move forward. In the daily struggle
against the paywalls of closed scholarship and science, there is much that the
current system can teach us as we seek to repurpose our swords as plowshares.
In the weeks and months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, could any greater
reason exist for the [Mauerspechte] to use hammers and pickaxes to break off
bits of the Wall as souvenirs other than to keep in our collective memory the
things we have learned from the experience?

And just as with the [reunification of Germany], realizing the Scholarly
Commons is not simply a matter of removing a wall and getting on with life as
usual. It will take new ways of thinking, new approaches, and reconstruction
that will include a whole lot of work. In this sense, the mascot of this post
can serve a dual purpose (and make a higher contribution to the future) if we
are willing to consider [a well-known parable][parable] that involves some
blind monks who had never before experienced an elephant. When given the
opportunity to examine one for the first time, each reached a different
conclusion based upon the part of the elephant he examined. The first felt the
trunk and thought the elephant was like a snake. Another felt the tusk and
thought it was like a spear. The third felt the tail and thought it was like a
rope. Yet another felt the leg thought it was like a tree. The monk who felt
the ear thought the elephant was like a fan. The last felt the side and thought
it was like a wall. Each was right about what he perceived, but all were wrong
about the elephant! Not one had a correct understanding of the whole.

Like the blind monks in this parable, people bring their own unique
perspectives to the idea of the Scholarly Commons. But it is precisely because
of the unavoidable fact that we each occupy a unique position in the world that
we inherit fragmented understanding and blind spots as to what others see from
their own respective vantage points. It is all too easy for us to be blinded by
our own interpretations of the features that we think we see. The Scholarly
Commons attracts people for so many different reasons that it is easy to wonder
whether it can possibly accommodate such seemingly divergent views. But this
does not mean that there is no hope for the future or that the Scholarly
Commons is forever undefinable and unknowable! Like the elephant in this
parable, the Scholarly Commons is something very specific. It is not simply a
catch-all bag for anything FAIR, Open, or Citable. It is a complex vision that
cannot be defined by [a few principles][principles] any more than an elephant
can be defined by a small set of superficial features or functions. The
Scholarly Commons is the convergence of all of these perspectives _and more_.

The point is that we need to define it.

_But what does that mean, and how do we do it?_ A general discontent with the
current system may have been enough to bring people together into some sort of
tacit agreement that things need to change, but this will not be enough to
carry us as we seek to move towards the future. It is easy to fall into the
trap of trying to define something new in terms of what it is _not_ rather than
in terms of what it _is_. We could innocently try to avoid this trap by not
saying anything at all, but underspecifying this new system does not eliminate
bias or make it more inclusive---it only makes it more vague, useless, and
unattainable. We don't want to err by overspecifying it either---we need to
leave room for local adaptation. We need a middle road between these two
extremes, a road paved with a shared understanding of what we want to be doing
and how we want to get there. If we are ever going to reach this convergence,
we will need to be explicit about _what exactly this new system is_. This is a
design problem at its heart and will require more than "a vague picture" to
ensure that "the assumptions it is based on are brought out into the
open."[^notes] It is not as simple as [taking stock of current centers][gaps
and systems] of "chaotic innovation" since many current innovations are
extensions of the current system and grounded in its logic. We need to approach
this rationally in an open, direct, and collaborative manner, keeping in mind
that the Scholarly Commons is something that we need to discover as much as we
need to define. We cannot define it blindly or willfully. There are real
dynamics here that we need to figure out. Many facets and perspectives need to
be considered and consolidated. Differences need to be reconciled in a spirit
of mutual respect, kindness, and understanding. The key to all of this is a
willingness to honestly ask the questions that need to be asked and to accept
the answers to those questions whatever they may be.

[While many things are needed]{.newthought} to bring about this convergence, it
is with the hope that we can contribute to that process that I am announcing
here a series of vignettes, to prompt a few of the many fundamental discussions
that need to happen around this important topic and to paint the picture of the
Scholarly Commons from various perspectives. Although we are painting here with
the broad stroke of our own opinion, we are making every effort to base our
opinion on sound reasoning and common sense. In many cases, these vignettes are
the first foray onto a topic and they most definitely should _not_ be viewed as
the last word on any. They do not reflect any formal process of consensus,
though we hope that they may be stepping stones that lead in that direction.
The intent is to raise questions, open the discussion, and broaden our
collective horizons, with the hope that through this exercise, we can come to
some understanding as to which questions we need to be asking, and, not any
less important, how best to find answers to those questions.
