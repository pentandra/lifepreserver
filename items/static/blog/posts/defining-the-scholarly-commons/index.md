A little over two years ago, FORCE11 received a grant to try to answer the
question, _are we ready to define the Scholarly Commons?_ I was invited to be
on the steering committee of a working group created for this program, and to
date we have held several workshops in various parts of the world to try to
gather consensus on this topic with the hopes of answering this question in the
affirmative, or at least to gain a better understand what this question
actually means.

Our intention was to re-imagine scholarly communication starting from scratch
as a system explicitly designed for machine-based access and networked
scholarship, and not simply adapted from the paper-based system. But perhaps
because of the enormous scope of this challenge, it has been hard for people
(even those who have been involved in this for some time) to wrap our heads
around the idea, let alone get to the point where we understand what is needed
and how to move forward. It is often easier to point out problems than it is to
design solutions or even come up with new ways of thinking about old problems.
Perhaps out of fear that few would adopt a new system of scholarly
communication if it looked too different from our current system, we have yet
to approach some fundamental questions, the answers to which would go far in
helping us understand what it is that we're really talking about. It is my
intent in this post to affirm our need to sharpen our understanding of what we
are really asking here and provide an additional means by which we can move
forward along our path towards the Scholarly Commons.

<!--MORE-->

The Scholarly Commons is a completely different system, not just the next step
or a more "open" version of the current system. The purpose of this new system
is different. While some elements may be the same, the relationships between
those elements is different. They occupy a different position and must be
thought of in a different way. It is the context of a sea change of ideas,
something that hundreds of manifestos and declarations have pointed to---and
the hope of thousands and hundreds of thousands over hundreds of years. Many
efforts have been and currently are preparing the way for this new system,
including the Internet and the World Wide Web.

Perhaps because there is so much at stake here and [so many ways to do things
wrong][f11 discussion], it would seem so much easier to avoid risk and leave
the responsibility on others to figure out the details. There is a temptation
to leave it vague and indistinct, as if we could retain our innocence or feign
inclusivity if we approached it that way. And surely the complexity of this
problem gives us sufficient cause to retreat! But then we run the risk of not
achieving what we could have achieved; of all our work ending up insignificant
and unhelpful in answering the really important questions of what this actually
means and how to go about doing it.

One of the things I have noticed over the course of my own journey on this path
is that people bring their own perspectives to this idea. Just like [the
elephant in the well-known parable](#the-key-to-success), the Scholarly Commons
is something very specific, even though it is is hard to conceptualize or
define in one concise statement or short paragraph. It cannot be reduced to a
few simple principles. But that does not mean that it is indefinable. On the
contrary, if we are ever going to get anywhere, we're going to need to be more
explicit. A vague picture benefits no one except the guilty or naive, and there
are many facets and perspectives that need to be considered and consolidated.
"A logical picture is easier to criticize than a vague picture since the
assumptions it is based on are brought out into the open."[^notes] We need to
be willing to expose our assumptions and open ourselves to criticism in order
to achieve real convergence.

It is with the hope that we can stir up the discussion that I am announcing
here a series of vignettes, to prompt the many fundamental discussions that
have not yet happened around this important topic, and to paint the picture of
the Scholarly Commons from various perspectives. Of course, we are painting
here with the broad stroke of our own opinion, and these vignettes do not
necessarily reflect any formal process of consensus, though they may be a
stepping stone towards that. Some of these thoughts may have originated in
internal discussions of the steering committee of the Scholarly Commons Working
Group and we just have not had the chance to get the ideas out there. In many
cases these vignettes are the first foray onto a topic, though in all cases
they most definitely should _not_ be viewed as the last word on any. The intent
is to raise questions, open the discussion, and broaden our collective
horizons, with the hope that through this exercise, we can come to some
understanding as to which questions we need to be asking, and, not any less
important, how best to find answers to those questions. We may not agree on all
the answers to those questions or even how to go about obtaining them, and I
think that is okay. Surely there is room for rationality in this process. We
all have different motivations for doing what we do, and different desires for
the outcomes of it all. But it is in our best interest to come together, to
come to an agreement on what the important questions are, and to find shared
practices and values with which to build a foundation that would bring us
together. Maybe the Scholarly Commons is not something that any one of us can
define alone, but is truth that needs to be discovered---and it is the search
for that truth that will hold us together.

These vignettes are not meant to stand in isolation, but are meant to
contribute to the ongoing discussions that are being had across several
communities and initiatives, including the [CommonsPatterns] group and the
ongoing efforts of the [Scholarly Commons Working Group][scwg] (and subgroups)
at FORCE11, and, for those that are more technical in nature, perhaps
especially the [Topics Project] of (Sub) Working Group 4 and the [Linked
Research] initiative. Many of these vignettes are, at this point, nascent
thoughts or preliminary sketches. We'll publish each as soon as it feels that
it captures the essence of what we feel needs to be expressed. Here are a few
we're considering starting with. If you have ideas that you would like to
discuss or see discussed, we invite you to join in the conversation in
whichever way you're able.
