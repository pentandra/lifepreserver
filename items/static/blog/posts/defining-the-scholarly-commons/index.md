Almost two years ago, FORCE[11]{.oldstyle} received a grant to try to answer
the question, _are we ready to define the Scholarly Commons?_ I was invited to
be on the steering committee of a working group around this program, and to
date we have held four workshops in various parts of the world to try to gather
consensus on this topic with the hopes of answering this question in the
affirmative. Our intention was to design a new system of scholarly
communication from scratch as a system explicitly designed for machine-based
access and networked scholarship. But perhaps out of fear that few would adopt
a new system of scholarly communication if it looked too different from our
current system, we have yet to approach some fundamental questions and define
what it is that we're really talking about. Perhaps because there is [so much
at stake here][f11 discussion] and so many ways to do things wrong, it is
tempting to avoid risk and leave the responsibility on others to figure out the
details. But then we run the risk of not achieving what we could have achieved,
and all our work ending up insignificant and unhelpful in answering the really
important questions of how to actually do this.

It is with the hope that we can stir up the discussion that I am announcing
here a series of vignettes, to prompt the many fundamental discussions that
have not yet happened around this important topic, and to paint the picture of
the Scholarly Commons from various perspectives. Of course, we are painting
here with the broad stroke of our own opinion, and these vignettes do not
necessarily reflect the consensus of the SCWG steering committee. The intent is
to raise questions, open the discussion, and broaden our collective horizons,
with the hope that through this exercise, we can come to some consensus as to
which questions we need to be asking, and, not any less important, how best to
find answers to those questions. We may not agree on all the answers to those
questions or even how to go about obtaining them, and I think that is okay. We
all have different motivations for doing what we do, and different desires for
the outcomes of it all. But it is in our best interest to come together, to
come to an agreement on what the important questions are, and to find shared
practices and values with which to build a foundation that would bring us
together. Maybe the Scholarly Commons is not something that any one of us can
define, but is truth that needs to be discovered---and it is the search for
that truth that will hold us together.

Here are a few questions that we're starting with. If you have other ideas that
you would like to discuss or see discussed, we invite you to share them. We
want to involve anyone that would like to be involved, and invite you to share
your voice openly. We're working on a mechanism to allow people to contribute
to this discussion without needing to ask for our permission :joy:.
