OK. We've had people ask us why we are worrying about the bigger research
community. Shouldn't we be focusing on genealogy?

Good question.

Let me share with you some of our thoughts on the subject. Keep in mind that I
am an avid proponent of all those that build technologies for genealogy. I just
think that technology for genealogy is stuck right now. Don't get me wrong,
there are wonderful products coming out of these companies. The record
digitization and indexing are, in particular, amazing achievements that will
benefit researchers for many years to come. What I have beef with involves the
prolific, unsubstantiated family trees that seem to grow on everyone's wall.
Well, technologically speaking, I think the ladder is on the wrong wall, and
engineers at FamilySearch, Ancestry.com, and other great companies have taken
this paradigm very far, but it is not solving the problems that so desperately
need to be solved. I think it's time for a fresh look at that thing that we
call _genealogy_.

# A lofty goal

Now you may have a better idea now of what we are trying to accomplish with
Geungle. We are trying to reconstruct the entire history of mankind. This
touches upon every facet of mankind's sojourn on earth.

A lofty goal, you say? Yes! Unattainable? Probably, but there is a lot we can
do to understand the past even if we cannot reconstruct all of it...or even
come close. Despicable? Well, I wouldn't go that far, but there have been many
ugly and despicable things that have happened throughout mankind's existence,
and it is essential, when studying someone's life, to understand, at least to
some degree, all that they experienced, the good and the bad. Fortunately, we
don't have to experience it all for ourselves, though we may surely empathize.

So where does the bigger research community fit into all of this?

As we've learned ourselves what genealogical research looks like, all those
nice generational tree structures fade into the background,[^analysis-trees]
and we're left with similar types of semi-structured information that is found
in any other research field. There is [a lot of
momentum](/blog/heading-to-oai8/) in the general research community to develop
open technological standards that are domain agnostic. It totally makes sense
to collaborate.

Maybe the biggest reason is that we can't do it alone. We need all the help we
can get. Only as we come to an understanding of each person's human experience
can we have any confidence in the outputs of our research. That is why we need
all the help we can get. We need to cooperate with other research fields
because they are trying to make sense of this world, too. We need their
research and they need our research.[^ee]

While we could call it microhistory,[^life] the collection of all of these
microhistories amount to a large corpus of knowledge, studied from many
different perspectives. To study and truly understand who these people _were_,
genealogy requires us to know what they _knew_. In this way, genealogy is an
amalgamation of all the world's knowledge, set in historical context. 

Why, you say, would we need low-density particle physics research to help
determine the political affiliations of my Civil War ancestor? Well, you never
know, but we do need the physicist. They're human aren't they?

[^life]: 
    We've tried telling people that were writing software for [generational
    history](/blog/thoughts-about-rootstech-2012#what-is-a-user) or
    [microhistory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microhistory), but we've gotten
    a lot of blank looks, even from historians! When we say we're writing
    software for genealogy, people are _way_ more understanding.

[^analysis-trees]:
    Actually this is not entirely true. Trees and graphs are used in
    genealogical research, not as a publication format, but as a tool for
    analysis. They are great for trying to make sense out of the relationships
    in a family or community while working on a research question.
