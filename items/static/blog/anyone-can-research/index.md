There is a certain baggage around the word <i>scholar</i> in our culture, that
seeks for exclusivity. Competition seems to be ever-present in the world around
us. For [Knowledge Age] citizens, the motivation to compete based on what you
know is strong and ever growing. Yet the need to [increase in understanding]
has never been greater. As we seek for increased understanding, however, we
increasingly need to look at old things in new ways. To do this productively in
our ever-growing world, value must be placed more and more on community, not
just on individuality. [Communities of thought] that have been sharply
delineated in the past need to find overlap and relationships that have lain
hidden beneath the surface, so that they can understand and be understood in
context---as part of a bigger whole. Fresh perspectives can often come from
surprising places. Let me share a few examples.

# Some Good Examples

When Jack Andraka was [15]{.oldstyle}, he set out to discover a way to detect
early-stage pancreatic cancer. After reading hundreds of papers from [PubMed],
he made a breakthrough during biology class. He took his discovery to the <span
class="oldstyle">2012</span> Intel International Science and Engineering Fair,
and the rest, as they say, [has been history][Andraka TEDx].

While people around the world have championed him, a few from the scientific
community have scoffed at his debut achievements. While I agree with some of
[the reservations][biotech_whiz] Matthew Herper of Forbes Magazine holds
towards Jack Andraka's preliminary publication draft, I think Matthew missed an
opportunity here. Maybe Jack's biggest contribution to science so far wasn't
developing a cool biosensor while still in high school, but was showing the
world that science can be understood by anyone and that meaningful
contributions to complicated research domains are not out of reach, even for
young people. Too many artificial barriers are in place right now that stifle
research innovation and chill passion for discovery. It takes effort for sure,
sometimes even years of effort, but one thing is certain: you don't need to be
a PhD to contribute to the knowledge of the world. It would be good to remember
that not to long ago [science was dominated by amateurs][democratizing
research]. _Anyone_ can progress things, bringing in fresh new ideas from a
wealth of unique backgrounds and understandings. Questions can be answered more
quickly by bringing more eyes and minds together to work on a problem. Jack
also, like many others that are driven to make similar breakthroughs, had
personal reasons that impelled him forward in his research---a family friend
had recently died of pancreatic cancer.

[Oftentimes, practitioners will see things]{.newthought} that the theoreticians
miss. Not only that, but once they *do* see, practitioners will often have the
passion and influence needed to create change. As [we wrote about
before][hairdresser], Janet Stephens saw something historians missed. She had a
passion for old hairstyles, and set out to recreate them. She knew how to work
with hair and persisted until she found a solution. Historians had long
misinterpreted what Janet understood---and Janet was willing to share.

Josh Sommer is a good example of someone passionate about finding an
answer---passionate enough to do something about it. After he was diagnosed
with [chordoma], Josh founded the [Chordoma Foundation] to bring researchers
together in a race for a cure.  *Isn't this what [collaboration] is all about?*
We need more people of all types involved in research.

## What is Research Anyways?

<dfn id="dfn:research">Research</dfn> is what someone with a question does to
find an answer to that question. Often, the question is highly contextual, and
the answer is only useful to the original questioner, but many times the
question or the answer (or something in-between) could be useful to others. It
is important in this new world that we are creating that we make it as easy as
possible for anyone to research and *create* new knowledge---and that we make
it as easy as possible for anyone to [*learn from others*][opening knowledge].

Some of the early visionaries had things to say about this. [Charles F.
Kettering], who invented, among other things, the electric starter motor for
automobiles and [Freon] refrigerant for refrigeration and air conditioning
systems, said the following about research:

<figure class="bq grab">

> For many years there has been much misunderstanding as to just what research
> is. The popular conception seems to be that there is something mysterious
> about it, and before any research can be done it is necessary to have
> expensive scientific apparatus and large, elaborately equipped buildings.
> Actually, this is not so. Research isn't a physical thing at all but just a
> state of mind. It is a simple, organized way of trying to accomplish
> something you wish to do, so simple that anyone can do research anywhere at
> any time.

Kettering, from <a href="http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/page/page/4920708.htm"><cite>Research is a State of Mind</cite></a>, from a series of talks given during the intermission of the General Motors Symphony of the Air radio show, December [5, 1943]{.oldstyle}.</span></figcaption>

Charles Kettering was an inventor with a practical focus---an applied
researcher, but the same thing could be applied to [basic research] if we say
that research is a simple, organized way of trying to discover something that
you want to know.

# Anyone can Research?

I'm reminded of the [Pixar] movie [<cite>Ratatouille</cite>][Ratatouille IMDb].
As you may know, the whole premise of the movie is [Chef Gusteau]{lang=fr}'s
belief that *anyone can cook*. A talented rat named Remy is convinced that even
he can be a great chef, so he finds a willing human to partner with---a garbage
boy named Linguini---in becoming the cook of their collective dreams.

    <source property="schema:contentUrl" type="video/ogg" src="remy_finds_linguini.ogv" />
  </video>

Their abilities are put to the test when Anton Ego, the most discriminating
food critic in Paris, comes to their restaurant to sample food from the new
chef. He is greatly impressed, and remains until after the restaurant closes to
find out the chef's true identity. The following is a quotation from his
review:

<figure id="fig:ego" class="bq grab">

> In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for [Chef
> Gusteau]{lang=fr}'s famous motto, 'Anyone can cook.' But I realize, only now
> do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist;
> but a great artist can come from _anywhere_.

<figcaption>--- Anton Ego, restaurant critic from [<cite>Ratatouille</cite>][Ratatouille]</figcaption>
</figure>

In the past, scholarship and research were separated, now they are growing
closer than ever before. Likewise, not everyone can become a great researcher,
but a great researcher can come from _anywhere_. But like Remy and
Linguini, we each have different talents and abilities, and can accomplish much
more if we work together rather than on our own.

I would define a <dfn id="dfn:scholar">scholar</dfn> as someone who values
knowledge and seeks after it for understanding and to create _new knowledge_.

# Towards a Scholarly Commons

Why do we research? Is it to have a job? Is it to prove our intelligence, or to
increase our personal prestige? If so, this has not always been the reason.
When thinking about this I'm drawn back in time to the Republic of Letters and
the beginning of the Enlightenment. Maybe I'm blinded by my own presentism, but
as I read these early accounts, I get the impression that many of these early
researchers we driven by an insatiable curiosity to _know_ things that they did
not know. They did not care about status or tenure. For centuries people had
been kept from the truth because of religious dogma, and all of a sudden tools
were available that enabled _anyone_ to learn about the world around them.
Suddenly the world was very different than anyone could have guessed. What an
exciting time to be alive!

The future [research communication standards][tcp/ip] should transcend
incumbent scholarly circles. Future standards for scholarship should be
compatible and inviting for applied research, business research, and even
informal, ad hoc research. We need to lift our vision. If we sequester research
standards in the professional research community and fail to find a broader
application in the world, we're missing the dartboard entirely.
