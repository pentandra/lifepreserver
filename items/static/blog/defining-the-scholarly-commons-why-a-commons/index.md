The problem is, we're researchers, and instead of just letting things happen
the way most commons happen, we are trying to be informed by those who have
studied commons, such as Ostrom, Bollier, [Helfrich]{lang=nl}, or Grear, and
are attempting to build this thing, or at least organize it, deliberately. A
member of the SCWG steering committee has commented that the Scholarly Commons
is undertheorized, and one of the participants of this workshop commented that
the Scholarly Commons is underpracticed. With both I would agree. Much of the
time we're talking hypothetically right now, and we really don't know how all
this will play out in reality. But I think it is good to act according to the
understanding that we have, let the understanding come from where it may. Even
if we avoid some bumps by trying to apply what we learn from commoning theory,
I'm sure that we'll still experience enough trial and error and growing pains
throughout this process.
