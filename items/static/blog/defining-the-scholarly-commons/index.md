It's easy in a group setting for dominant voices or agendas, even if
well-intentioned, to shape a discussion in a way that is not representative of
the group, especially when confronted with the need to get things done. In a
way, this is the very problem we are trying to address with the Scholarly
Commons.

It is with the hope that we can stir up the discussion that I am announcing
here a series of vignettes, to prompt the many fundamental discussions that
have not yet happened around this important topic, and to paint the picture of
the Scholarly Commons from various perspectives. The intent is to raise
questions and broaden our collective horizons, with the hope that through this
exercise, we can come to some consensus as to which questions we need to be
asking, and, not any less important, how best to find answers to those
questions.

Here are a few questions that we're starting with. If you have other ideas that
you would like to discuss or see discussed, we invite you to share them. We
want to involve anyone that would like to be involved. We're working on a
mechanism to allow people to contribute to this discussion without needing to
ask for our permission :joy:.
