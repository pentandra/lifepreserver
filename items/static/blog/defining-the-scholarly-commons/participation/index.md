The Scholarly Commons is more about the scholarly and scientific knowledge than
it is about the current players---not that the current players don't matter,
but that the underlying purposes and motivations for this work---the
discoveries that will bless all of mankind and the commoning processes that
support them---are bigger than any one player, to which no one player or group
of players may lay claim.

While legislation and academic policies do need to be changed to incentivize
participation and value these broader contributions, researchers from remote
locales of the world, such as Tripura, India or Thai Nguyen, Vietnam, [will
have many more opportunities than they currently have][ravi's second post] to
participate and be heard.
