My thoughts on this, which I believe are consistent with commons theory and are
touched upon in [a blog post by Bruce Caron][collectives], is that a scholarly
commons will form because of a need---a need for understanding. People that
actually care about a certain knowledge will collect around a need to
understand and a desire to care for and further that knowledge in order to
satiate that need for understanding. This collective is the seed of a commons.
Discussions will ensue that will establish rules, traditions, and values
pertaining to how to deal with the shared resources of the commons, which will
include the active and latent knowledge of that field of study. The
subtractable resource around which a scholarly commons forms is the moments of
discovery that reveal, bit by bit, the latent knowledge within that field of
study. I'm using the term <dfn>discovery</dfn> very loosely here to mean any
new insight or understanding to the collective that aids in further discovery.
Once a contribution is made, it cannot be made again in quite the same way, and
once a new understanding is revealed to a collective, it cannot be discovered
to that collective anew. Like the [waves at the Banzai Pipeline beach][surfing
commons], these moments of discovery are a scarce resource. Once one of these
moments comes, it will never come again.

Scholarly commons can form around any type of knowledge. Scholarly commons can
be nested into multiple layers, either imitating the structure of the knowledge
around which it was created, or more likely, around the type of need it is
trying to fill.

If the moments of discovery are the subtractable resource of the commons, what
is being done with these resources right now? Surely they still exist, but they
are being privatized by researchers who lay claim to the ground, thinking of it
as their own exclusive property, hoping that others will not stumble onto their
territory before they have fully harvested, processed, and packaged the new
knowledge for resale. Perhaps this is a pessimistic perception, but why else
would researchers not share what they're working on but for fear of being
scooped?

The culture of the commons views things differently. Discoveries are still your
own, but there is no reason to hide your research from others. In actuality, it
is much more likely that the opposite is happening. There is every reason to go
out and *proclaim* the ground that you see so that other people can build on
top of it---not just for your own sake, but for the sake of everyone else in
the world that could be using your contribution right now. If your whole
process is open for everyone to see, there is not the fear of others taking
something away from you or claiming they have discovered something before you,
but a trust that others will come to help uncover that which was before hidden.

Though these contributions are smaller and more fine-grained, they are not
half-baked. They are independent in their own sphere of influence, and come
with more of a sense of immediate gratification, more feelings of service, and
many more ways to contribute.

In short: scholarly commons accelerate research because they expose the
subtractability of discoveries in a more efficient way.
