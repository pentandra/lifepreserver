  <h1>An Open Approach</h1>

    <p class="big">

      We're not your run-of-the-mill, proprietary business. We're here to help
      great research reach its potential. The right technology for research can
      amplify the efforts of great people everywhere to make the world a better
      place. We want to empower the researchers of the world, including
      ourselves, to solve their own problems and then reach out to lift others.

  <h2>Open Research</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      The future of research is open. Open research involves collaboration
      throughout the research process, not just at the end when conclusions are
      written. Better conclusions can be reached quicker when researchers from
      different backgrounds and locations work together in a spirit of mutual
      cooperation.

    </p>
    <p>

      To do this we need ways to open up and preserve the research process.
      Transparency throughout the research process allows other researchers to
      assess the true nature and caliber of a research project and even build
      on top of it. So much more progress is possible when research is done
      this way.

  <h2>Open Source</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      Open-source software is software whose source code is freely available to
      the public, enabling the use, reuse, and improvement of that code. It
      also refers to a culture of collaborative development. We are supporters
      of open-source software. Our entire infrastructure is built upon it. We
      plan to contribute much of our source code to the community. We hope that
      others will benefit from this code and contribute back.

  <h2>Open Business</h2>

  <div class="bd">
    <p>

      We are in business to help make research easier. We figure if we are not
      doing that, we are doing something wrong. It is more likely that we will
      get it right if we learn from the principles of open research and open
      source and involve the community in our business development. Many in the
      community may have more experience or different perspectives than we do.
      It would be foolish to ignore this wealth of knowledge, ideas, and
      experience as we try to meet the needs of that community. Just like
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation_XVII">no man is an island</a>,
      a business that isolates itself from its customers can't
      effectively give them what they need or want.

    </p>
    <p>

      We have a vision for <a href="/research/#the-future-of-research">the
        future of research</a>. We are more likely to attain that vision by
      opening the doors of knowledge, communication, and understanding between
      us and the community than by maintaining tight-lipped corporate secrecy.

      It's an experiment. We don't know how well it will work, but we think it
      will be great! No specific resume is required. ;) Please come and get
      involved!
