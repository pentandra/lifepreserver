There has been an ongoing discussion in the research community about how to
assess the impact and quality of research outputs. Much of this is driven by
the desire of funding agencies to fund the best research and of employers
to employ the best researchers. These are _good things_ that everyone would
agree with. Yet, how do you measure good research?

That is a surprisingly difficult question to answer.

The na√Øve approach to research assessment is to boil everything down to a
number---a metric. But you cannot reduce quality or impact down to a simple
quantitative singularity, unless it happens to be

Shortcuts to research assessment [don't work](http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/24/10/1505.full).
Our current degenerative system of research assessment is an outstanding
example of the need _not_ to do assessments this way.

Last December, a forward-thinking group of editors and publishers met to
discuss some of the problems with research assessment and came up with a
[declaration](http://am.ascb.org/dora/) that recommended eighteen ways to
improve the status quo. These are very doable things that we can do _now_ to
improve the situation, not some ivory-tower Mumbo Jumbo.

While this guidance is not a complete solution to the problem, it is a way to
improve the current system while improved methods of research dissemination are
explored. Quoting from the declaration, "Outputs other than research articles
will grow in importance in assessing research effectiveness in the future, but
the peer-reviewed research paper will remain a central research output that
informs research assessment. Our recommendations therefore focus primarily on
practices relating to research articles published in peer-reviewed journals but
can and should be extended by recognizing additional products...as important
research outputs."

In general, the declaration recommends to not rely solely upon journal metrics
as a measure of the quality of research articles, individual contributions, or
in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions. This should be obvious, but it just
shows how messed up our system really is.

We can get so caught up in metrics that we forget what it is that we are
actually measuring. The two most common reasons to use metrics are to measure
the impact and the quality of research. It is hard to measure impact. Measuring
impact takes time, even decades. But we should be able to measure quality.
Quality is an inherent part of the research process. Impact is not necessarily
under the control of the researcher, but quality is. So, ideally, we should be
basing our assessments and hiring, promotion, and funding decisions not upon
impact, but upon research quality. Impact presupposes quality.

# Research Assessment in one field

In the field of genealogy there is an unusually disproportionate amount of
cloddy research that is published. On one hand are the ever-proliferating
online family trees that have no published analytical backing (or, all too
often, no analytical backing at all). On the other hand are high-quality
peer-reviewed articles from journals such as the National Genealogical Society
Quarterly. While the dichotomy between mediocre and quality research outputs in
this field may seem like a disadvantage, it also implies that there is a great
opportunity for education and a need for accurate and understandable
assessments of research quality.

So little of the research output is published on a family tree that it is
essentially impossible to assess the quality of the research. If we look at a
journal article, however, we get a lot more to go on. Yet, is that enough? How
do we measure the quality of research in a journal article? Do we measure it by
  how many footnotes there are, or the percentage of the page they take up?

In genealogical research, we would use the [Genealogical Proof
Standard](http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html) (GPS) to
measure research quality. The GPS outlines five
criteria that, when used together, are a good measure of research quality. In
other fields there are similar standards of research. In the end, you don't end
up with a quick and easy number, but you _do_ get an understanding of whether
the research is solid or lacking. Research must be assessed as a whole.

These are some of my initial thoughts on this, and I am still trying to think
through the many issues involving the assessment of research quality. I would
love to invite you to share your thoughts!

So how do _you_ measure research?
