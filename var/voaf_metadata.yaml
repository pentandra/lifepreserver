  :title: Cinelab ontology
  :description: |-
    The Advene project aims at providing a model and various formats to share annotations about digital video documents (movies, courses, conferences...), as well as tools to edit and visualize the hypervideos generated from both the annotations and the audiovisual documents. Teachers, moviegoers, etc. can use them to exchange multimedia comments and analyses about video documents.

    The Cinelab model allows not only to represent video annotations, but also an elicitation of their structure (through notions of schema and annotation type), as well as their presentations with views (templates applied on data to produce hypervideos) and queries.

    This model has been developed by the partners of the Cinelab project (2007-2008, funded by the french national research agency), and used afterwards in a number of projects and applications, including Advene (LIRIS) and Ligne de temps (IRI).

  :title: Software Work Product Model
  :description: During the modeling of software processes, work products are traditionally
    treated as atomic units, with names but no structure, and they are generated or
    changed during the course of the projects. In fact, the language SPEM does not
    offer mechanisms to detail the structure of work products, allowing only identify
    whether it is an artifact, a deliverable or an outcome of the project. The typical
    work products in the software processes are often documents or source code and
    they are managed from specialized or generic tools. For example, software modeling
    tools such as Rational Rose, or version control systems such as Git are examples
    of specialized tools that provide support to the management of certain types of
    work products. However, other generic tools such as content management systems,
    document management systems and collaborative editing systems or wikis can also
    be used to manage evidences of the processes. The design of models for certain
    types of work products has been an approach used in model-driven web methodologies.
    However, it is common the need for adapting and customizing well-known methodologies
    for their application in concrete situations and in specific organizations, a.k.a.
    process tailoring. Therefore, a vocabulary to define flexible work products in
    terms of structure and type of its artifacts is proposed here.
