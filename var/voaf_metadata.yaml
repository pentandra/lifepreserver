  :title: Cinelab ontology
  :description: |-
    The Advene project aims at providing a model and various formats to share annotations about digital video documents (movies, courses, conferences...), as well as tools to edit and visualize the hypervideos generated from both the annotations and the audiovisual documents. Teachers, moviegoers, etc. can use them to exchange multimedia comments and analyses about video documents.

    The Cinelab model allows not only to represent video annotations, but also an elicitation of their structure (through notions of schema and annotation type), as well as their presentations with views (templates applied on data to produce hypervideos) and queries.

    This model has been developed by the partners of the Cinelab project (2007-2008, funded by the french national research agency), and used afterwards in a number of projects and applications, including Advene (LIRIS) and Ligne de temps (IRI).

  :title: Atom Syndication Ontology
  :description: The AtomOWL ontology is inspired from the work done by the atom working
    group. This ontology is working off the rfc 4287 published among othe places at
    http://www.atompub.org/rfc4287.html . The AtomOWL ontology uses as much as possible
    the same terms as the format there to make the relation easy to understand. The
    AtomOWL name space is slightly different from the atom namespace [see post http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg16476.html].
    But this is a good thing as it helps distinguish the ontology from the rfc 4287
    serialisation.

  :title: The ESCO ontology
  :description: |-
    The ontology of the taxonomy "European Skills, Competences, qualifications and Occupations".

    The ontology considers three ESCO pillars (or taxonomy) and 2 registers.
    The three pillars are:
    - Occupation
    - Skill (and competences)
    - Qualification

    For the construction and use of the ESCO pillars, the following modelling artefacts are used:
    - Facetting support to specialize ESCO pillar concepts based on bussiness relevant Concept Groups (e.g. species, languages, ...)
    - Conept Groups, Thesaurus array and Compound terms (as detailed in ISO 25964) to organize faceted concepts
    - SKOS mapping properties to relate ESCO pillar concepts to concepts in other (external) taxonomies (e.g. FoET, ISCO88 and ISCO08.  More mappings can be added in the future.)
    - Tagging ESCO pillar concepts by other (external) taxonomies (NUTS, EQF, NACE, ...)
    - Capture gender specifics on the labels of the ESCO pillar concepts
    - Rich ESCO concept relationships holding a description and other specific characteristics of the relation between two ESCO pillar concepts.

    ESCO maintains two additional registers:
    - Awarding Body
    - Work Context
    Awarding Bodies typically are referenced by ESCO qualifications.
    Occupations can have one or more work context.

  :description: |-
    This ontology is a reduced-in-scope version of the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO) which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. It has been re-worked to align entirely with the W3C's [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.

    Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO). This is because PROV, to which this ontology is completely mapped, does not have a templating system which can indicate what *should* occur in future scenarios.

    This ontology introduces only one new element for decision modelling over that which was present in the DO: an Agent which allows agency in decision making to be recorded.

  :title: Software Work Product Model
  :description: During the modeling of software processes, work products are traditionally
    treated as atomic units, with names but no structure, and they are generated or
    changed during the course of the projects. In fact, the language SPEM does not
    offer mechanisms to detail the structure of work products, allowing only identify
    whether it is an artifact, a deliverable or an outcome of the project. The typical
    work products in the software processes are often documents or source code and
    they are managed from specialized or generic tools. For example, software modeling
    tools such as Rational Rose, or version control systems such as Git are examples
    of specialized tools that provide support to the management of certain types of
    work products. However, other generic tools such as content management systems,
    document management systems and collaborative editing systems or wikis can also
    be used to manage evidences of the processes. The design of models for certain
    types of work products has been an approach used in model-driven web methodologies.
    However, it is common the need for adapting and customizing well-known methodologies
    for their application in concrete situations and in specific organizations, a.k.a.
    process tailoring. Therefore, a vocabulary to define flexible work products in
    terms of structure and type of its artifacts is proposed here.

  :title: Visual Modeling tool Model
  :description: In Software Engineering, as well as in other disciplines, it is common
    to use model-editing tools using a visual language. In particular, the editing
    tools allow you to design UML software models, so that let you manage much of
    the work products of a project. From the study of several UML tools, such as Enterprise
    Architect, Visual Paradigm for UML or Rational Rose, this vocabulary has been
    defined. This vocabulary represents the basic structure of these UML tools, but
    does not exclude others that allow you to use other visual languages for modeling
    software systems or other entities.

  :title: VIR - Visual Representation ontology
  :description: |-
    This ontology, called VIR, is an extension of CIDOC-CRM created to sustain propositions on the nature of visual elements and permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.
    With the term visual element, we refer to those signs identified in the visual space as distinct and documentable units, and subject to an analytical interpretation.
    The scope of this ontology is to s to provide a framework to support the identification, annotation and interconnections between diverse visual elements and presents and assist their documentation and retrieval. Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.
    VIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective. Visual objects can be, in fact, polysemic and ambiguous, and it is not so easy to pin down a denotative or connotative meaning because they are very much context-dependent.

    Aragon Interoperable Information Structure Ontology
    EI2A
  :description: |-
    The initiative Aragón Open Data was initiated by agreement of 17 of July of 2012 of the Government of Aragon. Under the same was ordered the start of the project to open public data and on February 6, 2013 was implemented through the Portal <a href="http://opendata.aragon.es/"> opendata.aragon.es </a>.

    Throughout this time there have been numerous works to achieve automation in the publication of information to ensure that third parties can reuse it in the best way. Given the volume of data that begins to exist, within the line of work of automation in information management, all those elements that help in the improvement of the <b> structuring of information </b>  and the <b> standardization of the data </b> contained in the databases are beginning to have a special relevance.

    Based on this, within the General Directorate of Electronic Administration and Information Society, the idea arises of generating a set of technical and legal rules that allow to deepen in that standardization and that lead to think in the creation of the Interoperable Information Scheme Of Aragon (E2IA). The E2IA thus emerges as the framework in which the open data and in general the information of the Government of Aragon can begin to be automated in a much more profound way. The E2IA has to have a number of technical, organizational and legal elements that need to be developed.

    For this reason, the Technological Institute of Aragon (ITAINNOVA) has been entrusted with carrying out actions consisting in identifying, studying and analyzing current research trends and technological development in relation to ontologies and dictionaries of data interoperability, defining the ontological proposal, performing The necessary tests to validate the ontological proposal and generate the text and web versions of the ontology.
