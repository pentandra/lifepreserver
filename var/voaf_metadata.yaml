  :title: Cinelab ontology
  :description: |-
    The Advene project aims at providing a model and various formats to share annotations about digital video documents (movies, courses, conferences...), as well as tools to edit and visualize the hypervideos generated from both the annotations and the audiovisual documents. Teachers, moviegoers, etc. can use them to exchange multimedia comments and analyses about video documents.

    The Cinelab model allows not only to represent video annotations, but also an elicitation of their structure (through notions of schema and annotation type), as well as their presentations with views (templates applied on data to produce hypervideos) and queries.

    This model has been developed by the partners of the Cinelab project (2007-2008, funded by the french national research agency), and used afterwards in a number of projects and applications, including Advene (LIRIS) and Ligne de temps (IRI).

  :title: Atom Syndication Ontology
  :description: The AtomOWL ontology is inspired from the work done by the atom working
    group. This ontology is working off the rfc 4287 published among othe places at
    http://www.atompub.org/rfc4287.html . The AtomOWL ontology uses as much as possible
    the same terms as the format there to make the relation easy to understand. The
    AtomOWL name space is slightly different from the atom namespace [see post http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg16476.html].
    But this is a good thing as it helps distinguish the ontology from the rfc 4287
    serialisation.

    (which are polymorphic) to describe which properties are applicable to a class,
    \nrather than `rdfs:domain/range` (which are monomorphic) to prescribe what classes
    must be applied to each node using a property.\nWe find that this enables more
    flexible reuse and combination of different ontologies.\nWe reuse the following
    ontologies and nomenclatures, and extend them where appropriate with classes and
    properties:\n\n- W3C Org, W3C RegOrg (basic company data), \n\n- W3C Time (officer

    PICO model when framing and publishing evidence based questions. The PICO model
    is widely adopted for describing healthcare evidence, furthermore is equally applicable
    in other evidence-based domains. It essentially provides a model for describing
    evidence in a consistent way.

  :title: The ESCO ontology
  :description: |-
    The ontology of the taxonomy "European Skills, Competences, qualifications and Occupations".

    The ontology considers three ESCO pillars (or taxonomy) and 2 registers.
    The three pillars are:
    - Occupation
    - Skill (and competences)
    - Qualification

    For the construction and use of the ESCO pillars, the following modelling artefacts are used:
    - Facetting support to specialize ESCO pillar concepts based on bussiness relevant Concept Groups (e.g. species, languages, ...)
    - Conept Groups, Thesaurus array and Compound terms (as detailed in ISO 25964) to organize faceted concepts
    - SKOS mapping properties to relate ESCO pillar concepts to concepts in other (external) taxonomies (e.g. FoET, ISCO88 and ISCO08.  More mappings can be added in the future.)
    - Tagging ESCO pillar concepts by other (external) taxonomies (NUTS, EQF, NACE, ...)
    - Capture gender specifics on the labels of the ESCO pillar concepts
    - Rich ESCO concept relationships holding a description and other specific characteristics of the relation between two ESCO pillar concepts.

    ESCO maintains two additional registers:
    - Awarding Body
    - Work Context
    Awarding Bodies typically are referenced by ESCO qualifications.
    Occupations can have one or more work context.

  :title: Relations for Reusing (R4R) Ontology
  :description: "R4R is a light-weight ontology for representing general relationships
    of resource for publication and reusing. It asserts that a certain reusing context
    occurred and determined by its two basic relations, namely, isPackagedWith and
    isCitedBy. The isPackagedWith relation declares the resource is ready to be reused
    by incorporating License and Provenance information. The Cites relation is an
    exceptional to isCitedBy which occurs only two related objects cite each other
    at the same time. Five resource objects including article, data, code, provenance
    and license are major class concepts to represent in this ontology. \n\nThe namespace
    for all R4R terms is http://guava.iis.sinica.edu.tw/r4r/"

  :title: BIBFRAME Vocabulary
  :description: The BIBFRAME model and vocabulary consider resources that are cataloged
    as works with corresponding instances (physical and/or electronic).  The metadata
    describing a work is an amalgamation of the some of the data that was formerly
    associated with the uniform title authority record combined with subject data
    that was associated with the bibliographic records. Thus each cataloging resource
    must have a work description, and, if the cataloging resource exists physically
    or electronically, one or more instance descriptions.

  :title: Agreements ontology
  :description: This Agreements Ontology is designed to model 'agreements' which are
    social contracts that include licenses, laws, contracts, Memoranda of Understanding,
    standards and definitional metadata. Its purpose is to support data sharing by
    making explicit the relationships between agreements and data and agreements and
    Agents (people and organisations). Eventually it will also help with the interplay
    between different classes of agreements.

  :title: Decision Provenance ontology (DecPROV)
  :description: |-
    This ontology is a reduced-in-scope version of the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO) which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. It has been re-worked to align entirely with the W3C's [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.

    Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO). This is because PROV, to which this ontology is completely mapped, does not have a templating system which can indicate what *should* occur in future scenarios.

    This ontology introduces only one new element for decision modelling over that which was present in the DO: an Agent which allows agency in decision making to be recorded.

  :description: "The objective of gUFO is to provide a lightweight implementation
    of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) [1-5] suitable for Semantic Web OWL
    2 DL applications. \n\nIntended users are those implementing UFO-based lightweight
    ontologies that reuse gUFO by specializing and instantiating its elements.\n\nThere
    are three implications of the use of the term lightweight. First of all, we have
    employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties
    for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1,
    2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support
    for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects
    in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight
    ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose
    of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge
    graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are
    discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation.
    \n\nThe 'g' in gUFO stands for gentle. At the same time, \"gufo\" is the Italian
    word for \"owl\".\n\n\nFor the source repository, see: <https://github.com/nemo-ufes/gufo>"

:http://spi-fm.uca.es/spdef/models/deployment/swpm/1.0:
  :title: Software Work Product Model
  :description: During the modeling of software processes, work products are traditionally
    treated as atomic units, with names but no structure, and they are generated or
    changed during the course of the projects. In fact, the language SPEM does not
    offer mechanisms to detail the structure of work products, allowing only identify
    whether it is an artifact, a deliverable or an outcome of the project. The typical
    work products in the software processes are often documents or source code and
    they are managed from specialized or generic tools. For example, software modeling
    tools such as Rational Rose, or version control systems such as Git are examples
    of specialized tools that provide support to the management of certain types of
    work products. However, other generic tools such as content management systems,
    document management systems and collaborative editing systems or wikis can also
    be used to manage evidences of the processes. The design of models for certain
    types of work products has been an approach used in model-driven web methodologies.
    However, it is common the need for adapting and customizing well-known methodologies
    for their application in concrete situations and in specific organizations, a.k.a.
    process tailoring. Therefore, a vocabulary to define flexible work products in
    terms of structure and type of its artifacts is proposed here.

  :description: In Software Engineering, as well as in other disciplines, it is common
    to use model-editing tools using a visual language. In particular, the editing
    tools allow you to design UML software models, so that let you manage much of
    the work products of a project. From the study of several UML tools, such as Enterprise
    Architect, Visual Paradigm for UML or Rational Rose, this vocabulary has been
    defined. This vocabulary represents the basic structure of these UML tools, but
    does not exclude others that allow you to use other visual languages for modeling
    software systems or other entities.

  :title: VIR - Visual Representation ontology
  :description: |-
    This ontology, called VIR, is an extension of CIDOC-CRM created to sustain propositions on the nature of visual elements and permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.
    With the term visual element, we refer to those signs identified in the visual space as distinct and documentable units, and subject to an analytical interpretation.
    The scope of this ontology is to s to provide a framework to support the identification, annotation and interconnections between diverse visual elements and presents and assist their documentation and retrieval. Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.
    VIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective. Visual objects can be, in fact, polysemic and ambiguous, and it is not so easy to pin down a denotative or connotative meaning because they are very much context-dependent.

    Aragon Interoperable Information Structure Ontology
    EI2A
  :description: |-
    The initiative Aragón Open Data was initiated by agreement of 17 of July of 2012 of the Government of Aragon. Under the same was ordered the start of the project to open public data and on February 6, 2013 was implemented through the Portal <a href="http://opendata.aragon.es/"> opendata.aragon.es </a>.

    Throughout this time there have been numerous works to achieve automation in the publication of information to ensure that third parties can reuse it in the best way. Given the volume of data that begins to exist, within the line of work of automation in information management, all those elements that help in the improvement of the <b> structuring of information </b>  and the <b> standardization of the data </b> contained in the databases are beginning to have a special relevance.

    Based on this, within the General Directorate of Electronic Administration and Information Society, the idea arises of generating a set of technical and legal rules that allow to deepen in that standardization and that lead to think in the creation of the Interoperable Information Scheme Of Aragon (E2IA). The E2IA thus emerges as the framework in which the open data and in general the information of the Government of Aragon can begin to be automated in a much more profound way. The E2IA has to have a number of technical, organizational and legal elements that need to be developed.

    For this reason, the Technological Institute of Aragon (ITAINNOVA) has been entrusted with carrying out actions consisting in identifying, studying and analyzing current research trends and technological development in relation to ontologies and dictionaries of data interoperability, defining the ontological proposal, performing The necessary tests to validate the ontological proposal and generate the text and web versions of the ontology.

    (EHAW) vertical. Clause 4.1 of the present document shortly introduces a high
    level view of the envisioned SAREF4EHAW semantic model and modular ontology, with
    the retained concepts (i.e. classes) and their relations. \nSAREF4EHAW extension
    has been specified and formalised by investigating EHAW domain related resources,
    as reported in ETSI TR 103 509, such as: potential stakeholders, standardization
    initiatives, alliances/associations, European projects, EC directives, existing
    ontologies, and data repositories. Therefore, SAREF4EHAW modular ontology shall
    both:\n - Allow the implementation of a limited set of typical EHAW related use
    cases already identified in ETSI TR 103 509, i.e.\n - Use case 1 ?elderly at home
    monitoring and support?,\n - Use case 2 ?monitoring and support of healthy lifestyles
    for citizens?,\n - Use case 3 ?Early Warning System (EWS) and Cardiovascular Accidents
    detection?.\n - Fulfil the eHealth Ageing Well related requirements provided in
    ETSI TR 103 509, mainly the ontological ones that were mostly taken as input for
    the ontology specification.\n\nSAREF4EHAW mainly reuses the following existing
    ontologies: SAREF, ETSI SmartBAN reference model, SAREF 4 Environment extension
    and W3C SSN System module. The following figure presents the high level view of
    SAREF4EHAW ontology.\n![SAREF4SYST overview](diagrams/SAREF4EHAW_Model.jpg)\nFor

    an upper level ontology, at service level, shall also behas been fully modelled

  :title: 'SAREF4SYST: an extension of SAREF for typology of systems and their inter-connections'
  :description: "The present document is the technical specification of SAREF4SYST,
    a generic extension of [ETSI TS 103 264 SAREF](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/02.01.01_60/ts_103264v020101p.pdf)
    that defines an ontology pattern which can be instantiated for different domains.
    SAREF4SYST defines Systems, Connections between systems, and Connection Points
    at which systems may be connected. These core concepts can be used generically
    to define the topology of features of interest, and can be specialized for multiple
    domains. The topology of features of interest is highly important in many use
    cases. If a room holds a lighting device, and if it is adjacent with an open window
    to a room whose luminosity is low, then by turning on the lighting device in the
    former room one may expect that the luminosity in the latter room will rise.\n\nThe
    SAREF4SYST ontology pattern can be instantiated for different domains. For example
    to describe zones inside a building (systems), that share a frontier (connections).
    Properties of systems are typically state variables (e.g. agent population, temperature),
    whereas properties of connections are typically flows (e.g. heat flow).\n\nSAREF4SYST
    has two main aims: on the one hand, to extend SAREF with the capability or representing
    general topology of systems and how they are connected or interact and, on the
    other hand, to exemplify how ontology patterns may help to ensure an homogeneous
    structure of the overall SAREF ontology and speed up the development of extensions.\n\nSAREF4SYST
    consists both of a core ontology, and guidelines to create ontologies following
    the SAREF4SYST ontology pattern. The core ontology is a lightweight OWL-DL ontology
    that defines 3 classes and 9 object properties.\n\nUse cases for ontology patterns
    are described extensively in  [ETSI TR 103 549 Clauses 4.2 and 4.3](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103549/01.01.01_60/tr_103549v010101p.pdf).\n\nFor
    the Smart Energy domain:\n\n- Electric power systems can exchange electricity
    with other electric power systems. The electric energy can flow both ways in some
    cases (from the Public Grid to a Prosumer), or in only one way (from the Public
    Grid to a Load). Electric power systems can be made up of different sub-systems.
    Generic sub-types of electric power systems include producers, consumers, storage
    systems, transmission systems. \n- Electric power systems may be connected one
    to another through electrical connection points. An Electric power system may
    have multiple connection points (Multiple Winding Transformer generally have one
    single primary winding with two or more secondary windings). Generic sub-types
    of electrical connection points include plugs, sockets, direct-current, single-phase,
    three-phase, connection points. \n- An Electrical connection may exist between
    two Electric power systems at two of their respective connection points. Generic
    sub-types of electrical connections include Single-phase Buses, Three-phase Buses.
    A single-phase electric power system can be connected using different configurations
    at a three-phase bus (RN, SN, TN types).\n\nFor the Smart Building domain:\n\n-
    Buildings, Storeys, Spaces, are different sub-types of Zones. Zones can contain
    sub-zones. Zones can be adjacent or intersect with other zones. \n- Two zones
    may share one or more connections. For example some fresh air may be created inside
    a storey if it has two controllable openings to the exterior at different cardinal
    points. \n\nA graphical overview of the SAREF4SYST ontology is provided in Figure
    1. In such figure:\n\n- Rectangles are used to denote Classes. The label of the
    rectangle is the identifier of the Class.\n- Plain arrows are used to represent
    Object Properties between Classes. The label of the arrow is the identifier of
    the Object Property. The origin of the arrow is the domain Class of the property,
    and the target of the arrow is the range Class of the property.\n- Dashed arrows
    with identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e. \"`<< >>`\") refer to OWL axioms
    that are applied to some property. Four pairs of properties are inverse one of
    the other; the property `s4syst:connectedTo` is symmetric, and properties `s4syst:hasSubSystem`
    and `s4syst:hasSubSystem` are transitive.\n- A symbol =1 near the target of an
    arrow denotes that the associated property is functional. A symbol ? denotes a
    local existential restriction.\n\n\n![SAREF4SYST overview](diagrams/overview.png)"

    context for construction-related datasets that are being distributed using Web
    technology as well as datasets that are not shared outside an organization such
    as local copies, work in progress and other datasets that remain internal. This
    dataset metadata encompasses the temporal context (period or snapshot), the type
    of content of the dataset (as-built, design, etc.) and relations between contextualized
    datasets (previous as-built, requirements related to a design, etc.). In addition,
    this DCAT extension also provides terminology for managing dataset distributions
    that are scoped to a certain (named or default) graph of an RDF file or quadstore.

  :title: Description Banking Archives Ontology
  :description: 'The ontology, presented here in a beta version, is based on the analysis
    of the documentation and descriptive requirements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Historical
    Archive and is intended to describe the content of historical banking documents
    and of some of the activities carried out by the bank, particularly in relation
    to third parties (loans, charity donations, seizures and confiscations, etc.),
    which involve the initiation of processes or the production of documents. The
    focal point of the descriptive model is the bank - an entity that initiates different
    types of processes, whose common feature is that they are structured into various
    stages/events - and the relationship between the documentation produced and the
    information it contains. In fact, this ontology is based on information collected
    from archived documents which describe various processes and activities carried
    out by banking institutions: the starting point for its construction were the
    inventories and databases of documentation stored in the Historical Archive which
    was produced by the various banks that over time were merged into Intesa Sanpaolo.
    The ontology was created to provide a sufficiently abstract representation and
    model for describing the processes of various banking activities from which the
    documentation was produced - from a company''s request for financing and its outcome,
    to the preparation of seizure, confiscation and asset restitution filings, to
    charitable contributions, just to mention a few examples - reusing models that
    were already well established and widely used. The structure of the proposed ontology
    is in fact intended to adapt to the various activities, described in the archive
    files that a banking institution performs in relation to third parties. The proposed
    ontology is therefore not an ontology on banking activity in general, but on the
    relationship between this activity and the documents that are produced. Moreover,
    its objective is not to describe the documents in the strict sense of the term,
    for which reference is made to OAD ontology. The purpose of this project is to
    lay the initial, and fundamental, building blocks for describing the complexity,
    variety, and breadth of the domain of archiving bank records and the data they
    contain. Despite having data from different banks relating to different activities
    and having already made arrangements for the integration of third-party datasets
    and ontologies, before completing the project we will have to wait for the processing
    of representations based on other types of documents and banking institutions,
    including non-Italian ones.'

    The Seas Trading Ontology defines concepts and relations to describe ownership, trading, bilateral contracts and market licenses:

    - players own systems and trade commodities, which have a price;
    - bilateral electricity contracts are connections between electricity traders at which they exchange
    electricity;
    - electricity markets are connections between electricity traders at which they exchange electricity,
    using a market license;
    - electricity markets can be cleared, and balanced;
    - evaluations can have a traded volume validity context

  :title: SQuAP Ontology
  :description: Quality, architecture, and process are considered the keystones of
    software engineering. ISO defines them in three separate standards. However, their
    interaction has been poorly studied, so far. The SQuAP model (Software Quality,
    Architecture, Process) describes twenty-eight main factors that impact on software
    quality in banking systems, and each factor is described as a relation among some
    characteristics from the three ISO standards. Hence, SQuAP makes such relations
    emerge rigorously, although informally. SQaAP-Ont is an OWL ontology that formalises
    those relations in order to represent and reason via Linked Data about software
    engineering in a three-dimensional model consisting of quality, architecture,
    and process characteristics.

  :title: 'TODO: Task-Oriented Dialogue management Ontology'
  :description: With the aim of enhancing natural communication between workers in
    industrial environments and the systems to be used by them, TODO (Task-Oriented
    Dialogue management Ontology) has been developed to be the core of task-oriented
    dialogue systems. TODO is a core ontology that provides task-oriented dialogue
    systems with the necessary means to be capable of naturally interacting with workers
    (both at understanding and at ommunication levels) and that can be easily adapted
    to different industrial scenarios, reducing adaptation time and costs. Moreover,
    it allows to store and reproduce the dialogue process to be able to learn from
    new interactions.

  :description: 'Ontology for legal entity identifier registration. It was designed
    for Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) Level 1 data corresponding
    to the Common Data Format version 2.1. It covers key reference data for a legal
    entity identifiable with an LEI. The ISO 17442 standard developed by the International
    Organization for Standardization defines a set of attributes or LEI reference
    data that comprises the most essential elements of identification. It specifies
    the minimum reference data, which must be supplied for each LEI: The official
    name of the legal entity as recorded in the official registers. The registered
    address of that legal entity. The country of formation. The codes for the representation
    of names of countries and their subdivisions. The date of the first LEI assignment;
    the date of last update of the LEI information; and the date of expiry, if applicable.'

  :title: Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation Level 2 Ontology - Who Owns Whom
  :description: Ontology for legal entity parent relationships. It was designed for
    Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) Level 2 data corresponding to
    the Relationship Record format, version 1.1. Legal entities that have or acquire
    an LEI report their ‘direct accounting consolidating parent’ as well as their
    ‘ultimate accounting consolidating parent’, or for International Branches ‘is
    an International Branch of'. Otherwise they must provide a Reporting Exception.

    System (GLEIS) requires that legal entities with an LEI provide information on
    their ultimate and direct accounting consolidating parents. Relationship reporting
    is mandatory with exceptions allowed for certain well-defined reasons. This ontology
    provides a simple structure for recording reasons for each exception by LEI.
