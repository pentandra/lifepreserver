# var directory

The `var` directory contains variable data files in the spirit and function of
the `/var` directory in the [File Hierarchy Standard (FHS)] of Linux.

These files are not meant to be manually edited, but are generated by Nanoc
commands and used as inputs to Nanoc data sources that generate items during
the nanoc load process.
