  :abstract: Citizen science (also known as crowd science, crowd-sourced science,
    civic science, volunteer monitoring or networked science) is scientific research
    conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists. Formally,
    citizen science has been defined as "the systematic collection and analysis of
    data; development of technology; testing of natural phenomena; and the dissemination
    of these activities by researchers on a primarily avocational basis." Citizen
    science is sometimes included in terms such as "public participation in scientific
    research", participatory monitoring and participatory action research.

  :abstract: Interdependence is the mutual reliance between two or more groups.In
    relationships, interdependence is the degree to which members of the group are
    mutually dependent on the others. This concept differs from a dependent relationship,
    where some members are dependent and some are not.In an interdependent relationship,
    participants may be emotionally, economically, ecologically and/or morally reliant
    on and responsible to each other. An interdependent relationship can arise between
    two or more cooperative autonomous participants (e.g. a co-op). Some people advocate
    freedom or independence as the ultimate good; others do the same with devotion
    to one's family, community, or society. Interdependence can be a common ground
    between these aspirations.

  :abstract: This article deals with decision-making as analyzed in psychology. See
    also Decision theory.In psychology, decision-making is regarded as the cognitive
    process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several
    alternative possibilities. Every decision-making process produces a final choice
    that may or may not prompt action. Decision-making is the process of identifying
    and choosing alternatives based on the values and preferences of the decision-maker.

  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Design
  :abstract: Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of
    an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business
    processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns).  Design has different connotations
    in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases the direct construction
    of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, cowboy coding and graphic
    design) is also considered to be design.Designing often necessitates considering
    the aesthetic, functional, economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the
    design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought,
    modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects
    may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate
    identities, business processes and even methods of designing.Thus "design" may
    be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or
    things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation, as is
    made clear by grammatical context.

  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Age_of_Enlightenment
  :abstract: The Age of Enlightenment or simply the Enlightenment or Age of Reason
    is an era from the 1620s to the 1780s in which cultural and intellectual forces
    in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional
    lines of authority. It was promoted by philosophes and local thinkers in urban
    coffee houses, salons, and Masonic lodges.  It challenged the authority of institutions
    that were deeply rooted in society, especially the Roman Catholic Church; there
    was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism.Philosophers
    including Francis Bacon (1562–1626), René Descartes (1596–1650), John Locke (1632–1704),
    Baruch Spinoza (1632–77), Pierre Bayle (1647–1706), Giambattista Vico (1668–1744),
    Voltaire (1694–1778), David Hume (1711–76), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), Cesare
    Beccaria (1738–94), Francesco Mario Pagano (1748–99) and Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727)
    influenced society by publishing widely read works.  Upon learning about enlightened
    views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such
    as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known
    as enlightened absolutism. Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the Scientific
    revolution, spearheaded by Newton.New ideas and beliefs spread around the continent
    and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious
    texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot
    and (until 1759) Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Some 25,000 copies of the 35 volume
    encyclopedia were sold, half of them outside France. The Dictionnaire philosophique
    (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by
    Voltaire (1694–1778) were revolutionary texts that spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.
    Some of these ideals proved influential and decisive in the course of the French
    Revolution, which began in 1789. After the Revolution, the Enlightenment was followed
    by an opposing intellectual movement known as Romanticism.

  :abstract: 'Essays are generally scholarly pieces of writing giving the author''s
    own argument, but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article,
    a pamphlet and a short story.Essays can consist of a number of elements, including:
    literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily
    life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all  modern essays  are
    written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g. Alexander Pope''s
    An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). While brevity usually defines an essay,
    voluminous works like John Locke''s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and
    Thomas Malthus''s An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples.In
    some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major
    part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats
    to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities
    in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are
    often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.The
    concept of an "essay" has been extended to other mediums beyond writing. A film
    essay is a movie which often incorporates documentary film making styles and which
    focuses more on the evolution of a theme or an idea. A photographic essay is an
    attempt to cover a topic with a linked series of photographs; it may or may not
    have an accompanying text or captions.'

  :abstract: 'Genealogy (from Greek: γενεά genea, "generation"; and λόγος logos, "knowledge"),
    also known as family history, is the study of families and the tracing of their
    lineages and history. Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic
    analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate
    kinship and pedigrees of its members. The results are often displayed in charts
    or written as narratives.The pursuit of family history and origins tends to be
    shaped by several motivations, including the desire to carve out a place for one''s
    family in the larger historical picture, a sense of responsibility to preserve
    the past for future generations, and a sense of self-satisfaction in accurate
    storytelling.'

  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holism
  :abstract: Holism (from Greek ὅλος holos "all, whole, entire") is the idea that
    systems (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic,
    etc.) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts.  This
    often includes the view that systems function as wholes and that their functioning
    cannot be fully understood solely in terms of their component parts.Holism is
    a form of antireductionism, which is the complement of reductionism. Reductionism
    analyzes a complex system by subdividing or reduction to more fundamental parts.
    For example, the processes of biology are reducible to chemistry, and the laws
    of chemistry are explained by physics.Social scientist and physician Nicholas
    A. Christakis explains that "for the last few centuries, the Cartesian project
    in science has been to break matter down into ever smaller bits, in the pursuit
    of understanding. And this works, to some extent... but putting things back together
    in order to understand them is harder, and typically comes later in the development
    of a scientist or in the development of science."

    the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results

    and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project.If the research

- :tag: Open Standards
  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_standard
  :abstract: An open standard is a standard that is publicly available and has various
    rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how
    it was designed (e.g. open process).  There is no single definition and interpretations
    vary with usage.The terms open and standard have a wide range of meanings associated
    with their usage.  There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize
    different aspects of openness, including the openness of the resulting specification,
    the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard.
    The term "standard" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized
    committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate
    on a consensus basis.The definitions of the term open standard used by academics,
    the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark,
    France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New
    Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation
    side, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ensures that its specifications can
    be implemented on a royalty-free basis.Many definitions of the term standard permit
    patent holders to impose "reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing" royalty
    fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard.  For
    example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized
    standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),  International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC), and ITU-T permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation
    will require payment of patent licensing fees. Among these organizations, only
    the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as "open standards", while
    the others refer only to producing "standards". The IETF and ITU-T use definitions
    of "open standard" that allow "reasonable and non-discriminatory" patent licensing
    fee requirements.There are those in the open-source software community who hold
    that an "open standard" is only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented
    and extended. While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary
    in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body,
    it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded. The typical example of
    “open source” that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by
    IBM and now referred to as Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft operating
    system and Intel microprocessor. There are three others that are most widely accepted
    as “open” which include the GSM phones (adopted as a government standard), Open
    Group which promotes UNIX and the like, and the Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer
    open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice
    for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors.Open
    standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as open formats.Many
    specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and
    only available under restrictive contract terms (if they can be obtained at all)
    from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification.  As such these
    specifications are not considered to be fully open. Joel West has argued that
    "open" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of "openness".
    Ultimately a standard needs to be open enough that it will become adopted and
    accepted in the market, but still closed enough that firms can get a return on
    their investment in developing the technology around the standard. A more open
    standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed
    enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the
    technology as they implement it. This occurred with the Wintel architecture as
    others were able to start imitating the software. Less open standards exist when
    a particular firm has much power (not ownership) over the standard, which can
    occur when a firm’s platform “wins” in standard setting or the market makes one
    platform most popular.

  :abstract: 'The Republic of Letters (Respublica literaria) is the long-distance  intellectual
    community in the late 17th and 18th centuries in Europe and America. It fostered
    communication among the intellectuals of the Age of Enlightenment, or "philosophes"
    as they were called in France.  The Republic of Letters emerged in the 17th century
    as a self-proclaimed community of scholars and literary figures that stretched
    across national boundaries but respected differences in language and culture.  These
    communities that transcended national boundaries formed the basis of a metaphysical
    Republic.  Because of societal constraints on women, the Republic of Letters consisted
    mostly of men. As such, many scholars use "Republic of Letters" and "men of letters"
    interchangeably.The circulation of handwritten letters was necessary for its function
    because it enabled intellectuals to correspond with each other from great distances.
    All citizens of the 17th-century Republic of Letters corresponded by letter, exchanged
    published papers and pamphlets, and considered it their duty to bring others into
    the Republic through the expansion of correspondence.The first known occurrence
    of the term in its Latin form (Respublica litteraria) is in a letter by Francesco
    Barbaro to Poggio Bracciolini dated July 6, 1417; it was used increasingly in
    the 16th and 17th, so that by the end of that century it featured in the titles
    of several important journals.  Currently, the consensus is that Pierre Bayle
    first translated the term in his journal Nouvelles de la République des Lettres
    in 1664.  But there are some historians who disagree and some have gone so far
    as to say that its origin dates back to Plato''s Republic.  Part of the difficulty
    in determining its origin is that, unlike an academy or literary society, it existed
    only in the minds of its members.Historians are presently debating the importance
    of the Republic of Letters in influencing the Enlightenment. Today, most Anglo-American
    historians, whatever their point of entry to debate, occupy a common ground: the
    Republic of Letters and the Enlightenment were distinct.'

  :abstract: Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand";
    and -λογία, -logia) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes
    used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives,
    such as scientific investigation.  Technology can be the knowledge of techniques,
    processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories,
    which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings
    of such things.The human species' use of technology began with the conversion
    of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control
    fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food
    and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.
    Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and
    the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans
    to interact freely on a global scale.  The steady progress of military technology
    has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear
    weapons.Technology has many effects.  It has helped develop more advanced economies
    (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class.
    Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution,
    and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various
    implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology
    often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of
    efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines,
    and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over
    the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the
    human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary
    movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining
    that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such
    as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress
    as beneficial to society and the human condition.  Until recently, it was believed
    that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st
    century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities
    have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.
