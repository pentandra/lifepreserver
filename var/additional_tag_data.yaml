  :abstract: A business model is an "abstract representation of an organization, be
    it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural,
    co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization
    presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the
    organization offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed
    to achieve its strategic goals and objectives." This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh
    and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational
    infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products,
    services, and information), value finance (modeling information related to total
    cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network
    articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models. A business
    model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures
    value, in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of business
    model construction is part of business strategy. In theory and practice, the term
    business model is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to
    represent core aspects of a business, including purpose, business process, target
    customers, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, sourcing,
    trading practices, and operational processes and policies including culture. The
    literature has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions of a business
    model. A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines
    business models as the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial
    opportunity. Further extensions to this design logic emphasize the use of narrative
    or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs
    create extraordinarily successful growth firms. Business models are used to describe
    and classify businesses, especially in an entrepreneurial setting, but they are
    also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities for future development.
    Well-known business models can operate as "recipes" for creative managers. Business
    models are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting
    for purposes of public reporting.

  :abstract: Citizen science (also known as crowd science, crowd-sourced science,
    civic science, volunteer monitoring or networked science) is scientific research
    conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists. Formally,
    citizen science has been defined as "the systematic collection and analysis of
    data; development of technology; testing of natural phenomena; and the dissemination
    of these activities by researchers on a primarily avocational basis." Citizen
    science is sometimes included in terms such as "public participation in scientific
    research", participatory monitoring and participatory action research.

  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interdependence
  :abstract: Interdependence is the mutual reliance between two or more groups. This
    concept differs from the reliance in a dependent relationship, where some members
    are dependent and some are not. There can be various degrees of interdependence.
    In an interdependent relationship, participants may be emotionally, economically,
    ecologically and/or morally reliant on and responsible to each other. An interdependent
    relationship can arise between two or more cooperative autonomous participants
    (e.g. a co-op). Some people advocate freedom or independence as the ultimate good;
    others do the same with devotion to one's family, community, or society. Interdependence
    can be a common ground between these aspirations.

- :tag: Culture
  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture
  :abstract: Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/) can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of
    anthropologist E.B. Tylor it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge,
    belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired
    by man as a member of society." Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture
    is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material
    expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of
    social meaning of a life held in common." Cambridge English Dictionary states
    that culture is "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs,
    of a particular group of people at a particular time."Terror Management Theory
    posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans
    with the basis for perceiving themselves as "person[s] of worth within the world
    of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence,
    in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo Sapiens became
    aware of when they acquired a larger brain. As a defining aspect of what it means
    to be human, culture is a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range
    of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies.
    The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent
    experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability
    arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years
    ago. This capacity is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other
    species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social
    learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated
    knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social interaction and exist in
    specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form. Some aspects of human
    behavior, such as language, social practices such as kinship, gender and marriage,
    expressive forms such as art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies
    such as cooking, shelter, clothing are said to be cultural universals, found in
    all human societies. The concept material culture covers the physical expressions
    of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects
    of culture such as principles of social organization (including, practices of
    political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature
    (both written and oral), and science make up the intangible cultural heritage
    of a society. In the humanities, one sense of culture, as an attribute of the
    individual, has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level
    of sophistication, in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of
    cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish civilizations
    from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also
    found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and
    a low culture, popular culture or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished
    by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often
    used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish
    themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry.
    Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture
    that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism
    and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool
    of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness,
    such perspectives common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social
    sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human
    symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans
    create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is
    found in evolved biological dispositions. When used as a count noun, "a culture"
    is the set of customs, traditions, and values of a society or community, such
    as an ethnic group or nation. In this sense, multiculturalism is a concept that
    values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures
    inhabiting the same territory. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific
    practices within a subgroup of a society, a subculture (e.g. "bro culture"), or
    a counter culture. Within cultural anthropology, the ideology and analytical stance
    of cultural relativism holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked
    or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system
    of a given culture.

    in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities.
    Every decision-making process produces a final choice; it may or may not prompt

  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Design
  :abstract: Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of
    an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in architectural blueprints,
    engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns).
    Design has different connotations in different fields (see  below). In some cases,
    the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management,
    coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be design. Designing often necessitates
    considering the aesthetic, functional, economic, and sociopolitical dimensions
    of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research,
    thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds
    of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers,
    corporate identities, business processes, and even methods of designing. Thus
    "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created
    thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation,
    as is made clear by grammatical context.

- :tag: Enlightenment
  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Age_of_Enlightenment
  :abstract: 'The Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Enlightenment; in French:
    le Siècle des Lumières, lit. ''the Century of Lights''; and in German: Aufklärung,
    ''Enlightenment'') was an intellectual movement which dominated the world of ideas
    in Europe in the 18th century. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered
    on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and came to advance
    ideals such as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government,
    and separation of church and state. In France, the central doctrines of les Lumières
    were individual liberty and religious tolerance in opposition to an absolute monarchy
    and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church. The Enlightenment was marked
    by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism along with increased
    questioning of religious orthodoxy - an attitude captured by the phrase Sapere
    aude, "Dare to know". French historians traditionally place the Enlightenment
    between 1715, the year that Louis XIV died, and 1789, the beginning of the French
    Revolution. Some recent historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start
    of the scientific revolution. Les philosophes (French for ''the philosophers'')
    of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies,
    Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffee houses, and through printed books and
    pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy
    and the Church, and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and
    19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and
    neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment. The
    Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the scientific
    revolution. Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included
    Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, and Baruch Spinoza. The major figures
    of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques
    Rousseau, David Hume, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant. Some European rulers, including
    Catherine II of Russia, Joseph II of Austria and Frederick II of Prussia, tried
    to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became
    known as enlightened absolutism.  Benjamin Franklin visited Europe repeatedly
    and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought
    the newest ideas back to Philadelphia. Thomas Jefferson closely followed European
    ideas and later incorporated some of the the ideals of the Enlightenment into
    the Declaration of Independence (1776). Others like James Madison incorporated
    them into the Constitution in 1787. The most influential publication of the Enlightenment
    was the Encyclopédie (Encyclopaedia). Published between 1751 and 1772 in thirty-five
    volumes, it was compiled by Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond d''Alembert (until 1759),
    and a team of 150 scientists and philosophers and it helped spread the ideas of
    the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond. Other landmark publications were Voltaire''s
    Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary; 1764) and Letters on the
    English (1733); Rousseau''s Discourse on Inequality (1754) and The Social Contract
    (1762); Adam Smith''s The Wealth of Nations (1776); and Montesquieu''s Spirit
    of the Laws (1748). The ideas of the Enlightenment played a major role in inspiring
    the French Revolution, which began in 1789. After the Revolution, the Enlightenment
    was followed by an opposing intellectual movement known as Romanticism.'

    sources.Sources of funding include credit, venture capital, donations, grants,
    savings, subsidies, and taxes. Fundings such as donations, subsidies, and grants
    that have no direct requirement for return of investment are described as "soft
    funding" or "crowdfunding". Funding that facilitates the exchange of equity ownership
    in a company for capital investment via an online funding portal as per the Jumpstart
    Our Business Startups Act (alternately, the "JOBS Act of 2012") (U.S.) is known
    as equity crowdfunding.Funds can be allocated for either short-term or long-term

    lineages and history. Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic
    analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate
    kinship and pedigrees of its members. The results are often displayed in charts
    or written as narratives.The pursuit of family history and origins tends to be
    shaped by several motivations, including the desire to carve out a place for one''s
    family in the larger historical picture, a sense of responsibility to preserve
    the past for future generations, and a sense of self-satisfaction in accurate

  :abstract: Holism (from Greek ὅλος holos "all, whole, entire") is the idea that
    systems (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic,
    etc.) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts.  This
    often includes the view that systems function as wholes and that their functioning
    cannot be fully understood solely in terms of their component parts.Holism is
    a form of antireductionism, which is the complement of reductionism. Reductionism
    analyzes a complex system by subdividing or reduction to more fundamental parts.
    For example, the processes of biology are reducible to chemistry, and the laws
    of chemistry are explained by physics.Social scientist and physician Nicholas
    A. Christakis explains that "for the last few centuries, the Cartesian project
    in science has been to break matter down into ever smaller bits, in the pursuit
    of understanding. And this works, to some extent... but putting things back together
    in order to understand them is harder, and typically comes later in the development
    of a scientist or in the development of science."

- :tag: Open Access
  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_access
  :abstract: 'Open access (OA) refers to online research outputs that are free of
    all restrictions on access (e.g. access tolls) and free of many restrictions on
    use (e.g. certain copyright and license restrictions). Open access can be applied
    to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed
    academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.
    Two degrees of open access can be distinguished: gratis open access, which is
    online access free of charge, and libre open access, which is online access free
    of charge plus various additional usage rights. These additional usage rights
    are often granted through the use of various specific Creative Commons licenses.
    Libre open access is equivalent to the definition of open access in the Budapest
    Open Access Initiative, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the
    Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.
    There are multiple ways authors can provide open access to their work. One way
    is to publish it and then self-archive it in a repository where it can be accessed
    for free, such as their institutional repository, or a central repository such
    as PubMed Central. This is known as ''green'' open access. Some publishers require
    delays, or an embargo, on when a research output in a repository may be made open
    access. Several initiatives provide an alternative to the American and English
    language dominance of existing publication indexing systems, including Index Copernicus,
    SciELO and Redalyc. A second way authors can make their work open access is by
    publishing it in such a way that makes their research output immediately available
    from the publisher. This is known as ''gold'' open access, and within the sciences
    this often takes the form of publishing an article in either an open access journal,
    or a hybrid open access journal. The latter is a journal whose business model
    is at least partially based on subscriptions, and only provide Gold open access
    for those individual articles for which their authors (or their author''s institution
    or funder) pay a specific fee for publication, often referred to as an article
    processing charge. Pure open access journals do not charge subscription fees,
    and may have one of a variety of business models. Many, however, do charge an
    article processing fee. Widespread public access to the World Wide Web in the
    late 1990s and early 2000s fueled the open access movement, and prompted both
    the green open access way (self-archiving of non-open access journal articles)
    and the creation of open access journals (gold way). Conventional non-open access
    journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site
    licenses or pay-per-view charges. Some non-open access journals provide open access
    after an embargo period of 6–12 months or longer (see delayed open access journals).
    Active debate over the economics and reliability of various ways of providing
    open access continues among researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators,
    funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff
    and society publishers.'

- :tag: Open Standards
  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_standard
  :abstract: An open standard is a standard that is publicly available and has various
    rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how
    it was designed (e.g. open process). There is no single definition and interpretations
    vary with usage. The terms open and standard have a wide range of meanings associated
    with their usage. There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize
    different aspects of openness, including the openness of the resulting specification,
    the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard.
    The term "standard" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized
    committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate
    on a consensus basis.The definitions of the term open standard used by academics,
    the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark,
    France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New
    Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation
    side, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ensures that its specifications can
    be implemented on a royalty-free basis.Many definitions of the term standard permit
    patent holders to impose "reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing" royalty
    fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard.  For
    example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized
    standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),  International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC), and ITU-T permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation
    will require payment of patent licensing fees. Among these organizations, only
    the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as "open standards", while
    the others refer only to producing "standards". The IETF and ITU-T use definitions
    of "open standard" that allow "reasonable and non-discriminatory" patent licensing
    fee requirements.There are those in the open-source software community who hold
    that an "open standard" is only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented
    and extended. While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary
    in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body,
    it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded. The typical example of
    “open source” that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by
    IBM and now referred to as Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft operating
    system and Intel microprocessor. There are three others that are most widely accepted
    as “open” which include the GSM phones (adopted as a government standard), Open
    Group which promotes UNIX and the like, and the Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer
    open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice
    for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors. Open
    standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as open formats. Many
    specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and
    only available under restrictive contract terms (if they can be obtained at all)
    from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification. As such these
    specifications are not considered to be fully open. Joel West has argued that
    "open" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of "openness".
    Ultimately a standard needs to be open enough that it will become adopted and
    accepted in the market, but still closed enough that firms can get a return on
    their investment in developing the technology around the standard. A more open
    standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed
    enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the
    technology as they implement it. This occurred with the Wintel architecture as
    others were able to start imitating the software. Less open standards exist when
    a particular firm has much power (not ownership) over the standard, which can
    occur when a firm’s platform “wins” in standard setting or the market makes one
    platform most popular.

    Republic.  Because of societal constraints on women, the Republic of Letters consisted
    mostly of men. As such, many scholars use "Republic of Letters" and "men of letters"
    interchangeably.The circulation of handwritten letters was necessary for its function
    because it enabled intellectuals to correspond with each other from great distances.
    All citizens of the 17th-century Republic of Letters corresponded by letter, exchanged
    published papers and pamphlets, and considered it their duty to bring others into
    the Republic through the expansion of correspondence.The first known occurrence
    of the term in its Latin form (Respublica litteraria) is in a letter by Francesco
    Barbaro to Poggio Bracciolini dated July 6, 1417; it was used increasingly in
    the 16th and 17th, so that by the end of that century it featured in the titles
    of several important journals.  Currently, the consensus is that Pierre Bayle
    first translated the term in his journal Nouvelles de la République des Lettres
    in 1664.  But there are some historians who disagree and some have gone so far
    as to say that its origin dates back to Plato''s Republic.  Part of the difficulty
    in determining its origin is that, unlike an academy or literary society, it existed
    only in the minds of its members.Historians are presently debating the importance
    of the Republic of Letters in influencing the Enlightenment. Today, most Anglo-American
    historians, whatever their point of entry to debate, occupy a common ground: the
    Republic of Letters and the Enlightenment were distinct.'

  :abstract: A review is an evaluation of a publication, service, or company such
    as a movie (a movie review), video game (video game review), musical composition
    (music review of a composition or recording), book (book review); a piece of hardware
    like a car, home appliance, or computer; or an event or performance, such as a
    live music concert, play, musical theater show, dance show, or art exhibition.
    In addition to a critical evaluation, the review's author may assign the work
    a rating to indicate its relative merit. More loosely, an author may review current
    events, trends, or items in the news. A compilation of reviews may itself be called
    a review. The New York Review of Books, for instance, is a collection of essays
    on literature, culture, and current affairs. National Review, founded by William
    F. Buckley, Jr., is an influential conservative magazine, and Monthly Review is
    a long-running socialist periodical.

  :uri: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_business
  :abstract: "Social business was defined by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Professor
    Muhammad Yunus and is described in his books Creating a world without poverty—Social
    Business and the future of capitalism and Building Social Business—The new kind
    of capitalism that serves humanity's most pressing needs. In these books, Yunus
    defined a social business as a business: \n*  Created and designed to address
    a social problem \n*  A non-loss, non-dividend company, i.e. 1.  \n*  It is financially
    self-sustainable and 2.  \n*  Profits realized by the business are reinvested
    in the business itself (or used to start other social businesses), with the aim
    of increasing social impact, for example expanding the company’s reach, improving
    the products or services or in other ways subsidizing the social mission. Unlike
    a profit-maximizing business, the prime aim of a social business is not to maximize
    profits (although generating profits is desired). Furthermore, business owners
    are not receiving any dividend out of the business profits, if any. On the other
    hand, unlike a non-profit, a social business is not dependent on donations or
    on private or public grants to survive and to operate, because, as any other business,
    it is self-sustainable. Furthermore, unlike a non-profit, where funds are spent
    only once on the field, funds in a social business are invested to increase and
    improve the business' operations on the field on an indefinite basis. Per Yunus'
    quote: \"A charity dollar has only one life; a social business dollar can be invested
    over and over again.\" Philosophically, social business is based on what Yunus
    identifies as the two basic motives of human beings, selfishness and selflessness.
    Selfishly, people do seek profit through business; however, social business is
    also based on the latter motive people by performing philanthropic services, like
    establishing churches, mosques, synagogues, art museums, public parks, health
    clinics or community centers. For Yunus, the profits made through a social business's
    operations are less important than the beneficial effects it has on society. Muhammad
    Yunus has more recently founded  Yunus Social Business (YSB) to study, support,
    and invest in young social businesses. A Social business is sometimes used interchangeably
    or in comparison to a Social Enterprise - some have described this as a spectrum,
    ranging from profit-first corporations to non-profits or charities, with Social
    Enterprises closer to non-profits and social Businesses closer to for-profits."

  :abstract: Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand";
    and -λογία, -logia) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes
    used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives,
    such as scientific investigation.  Technology can be the knowledge of techniques,
    processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories,
    which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings
    of such things.The human species' use of technology began with the conversion
    of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control
    fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food
    and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.
    Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and
    the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans
    to interact freely on a global scale.  The steady progress of military technology
    has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear
    weapons.Technology has many effects.  It has helped develop more advanced economies
    (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class.
    Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution,
    and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various
    implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology
    often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of
    efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines,
    and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over
    the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the
    human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary
    movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining
    that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such
    as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress
    as beneficial to society and the human condition.  Until recently, it was believed
    that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st
    century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities
    have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.

  :abstract: The World Wide Web (www, W3) is an information space where documents
    and other web resources are identified by URLs, interlinked by hypertext links,
    and can be accessed via the Internet. It has become known simply as the Web. The
    World Wide Web was central to the development of the Information Age and is the
    primary tool billions use to interact on the Internet, and it has changed people's
    lives immeasurably.The World Wide Web was invented by English scientist Tim Berners-Lee
    in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.Web
    pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup
    Language (HTML). In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images,
    video, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as
    coherent pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate
    between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common domain name,
    or both, may be called a website. Website content can largely be provided by the
    publisher, or interactive where users contribute content or the content depends
    upon the user or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily
    for entertainment, or largely for commercial purposes.
