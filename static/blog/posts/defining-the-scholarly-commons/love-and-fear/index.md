, but you have
to remember (as I'm sure by now that you would rather forget) that many
people in the research community, even though they want a new system and
are as frustrated by the old system as any of us, are skeptical of anything
that is too different from what they are used to. I am confident that there
are answers here that can help to reconcile some of these fears if we can
seek them out together in an open, safe environment.
