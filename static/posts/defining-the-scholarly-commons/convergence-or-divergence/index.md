_Are we ready to define the Scholarly Commons?_ asked at each workshop

There's something of morality, duty or responsibility in the idea of the
Scholarly Commons.

It's easy in a group setting for dominant voices or agendas, even if
well-intentioned, to shape a discussion in a way that is not representative of
the group, especially when confronted with the need to get things done. In a
way, this is the very problem we are trying to address with the Scholarly
Commons. [Jonathan Sacks said, "In a debate in which there are no shared
standards, the loudest voice wins." Deciding right and wrong is more than a
show of strength---it is about the wellbeing of the individual and the common
good. Thus, he continues, "if there is no moral truth, there is only victory.
The pursuit of truth mutates into the will to power." The _commons_ in the
framework of the Scholarly Commons should help the weak _and_ the strong, the
quiet _and_ the loud, the minority _and_ the majority.]

# The futility of multiculturalism

The Scholarly Commons is designed for [a pluralistic world---one in which many
different ideologies, ethnicites and worldviews exist side-by-side, and we have
little choice but to engage these various sources as we seek to promote the
good.]

[Ultimately, a diverse culture cannot thrive on individual moralities---an idea
as inconceivable, Sacks, says, as "a private language that only one person
understands." In a society where individual autonomy is judged to be the
greatest good, everything is up to the individual. Here is how French thinker
Alexis de Tocqueville described this lonely quest: "If each undertook himself
to form all his opinions and to pursue truth in isolation down paths cleared by
him alone, it is not probable that a great number of men would ever unite in
any common belief." And in such a situation, people still exist, "but a social
body does not."]

[We may not agree on all the specifics of a common moral code---something
neither possible nor desirable---but it is in our interest to find agreement on
the crucial questions. After all, morality is not what any one of us decides,
"it's what holds a group together."]

# Convergence

I have over thirty blog posts that I have been working on over this period that
I have not yet published. Talk about a self-imposed embargo period! There are
several excuses for this:

1. A desire to make sure that every thing that I publish is perfect and
   complete.
2. Many of these are the beginnings of a thought and I have not considered them
   worthy of publishing.
3. I have wanted to stick too much in one post so that it is a complete
   thought. I need to trust that it is okay to spread things across multiple
   posts, the same way that it is okay to break thoughts into paragraphs and
   sections. Just because they have different identifiers does not shard them
   irreconcilably. I need to be okay with spreading out my thoughts. But I also
   need to think of ways to connect these pieces together.

It may seem like a shock to you, but this revolution in scholarly communication
will not happen first within the academy. It will disrupt the academy.
