## Scholarly commons

My thoughts on this, which I believe are consistent with commons theory and are
touched upon in [a blog post by Bruce Caron][collectives], is that a scholarly
commons will form because of a need---a need for understanding. People that
actually care about a certain knowledge will collect around a need to
understand and a desire to care for and further that knowledge in order to
satiate that need for understanding. This collective is the seed of a commons.
Discussions will ensue that will establish rules, traditions, and values
pertaining to how to deal with the shared resources of the commons, which will
include the active and latent knowledge of that field of study. Scholarly
commons can form around any type of knowledge. Scholarly commons can be nested
into multiple layers, either imitating the structure of the knowledge around
which it was created, or more likely, around the type of need it is trying to
fill.
