It seems that the going trend in the genealogical industry right now is, "Did
you find a new ancestor today?" 

People have been trained to add more and more
names to their family tree, the more, the better. If you don't find anything
today, you have wasted a good day. This is just like the reward system for the
airport screeners. Airport screeners look for keys. Genealogists look for
names. Computer programs make it easy to enter a name into a spot on your
family tree. And everything is great!  However what most people do not realize
is that if you make one mistake, all the research after that (on that line) is
a waste of time and money. The reward system needs to be changed from a focus
on the quantity of names to the quality of research. Only then will we be able
to make real progress in understanding our past. To do that we need to
reconstruct the lives of our ancestors and come to know who they really were.
That, to me, is a greater reward that a bunch of vital statistics.
