  <h2>The Zeugma Princess</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      <span class="newthought">The Zeugma Princess</span> is our pet name for
      what is commonly referred to as the Gypsy Girl Mosaic fragment. Her eyes
      seem to convey some haunting tale, but she has no mouth to tell us the
      story. She was found in the ancient
      <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma,_Commagene">city of Zeugma</a>,
      located in the present-day Gaziantep province of Turkey. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Zeugma was named for its bridge of boats that enabled passage across the
      Euphrates. In Greek,
      <dfn title="zeugma"><a rel="external" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dzeu%3Dgma">zeugma</a></dfn>
      literally means <em>bridge</em> or <em>bond</em>. The city reached its
      heights of affluence during the period of Roman rule, which commenced in
      <span class="oldstyle">64</span> <abbr>AD</abbr>. In <abbr>AD</abbr>
      <span class="oldstyle">256</span>, the city was conquered and destroyed by
      <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_I">King Shapur I</a>
      of the Persian Empire.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      The mosaic is now on display at the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology.
      The <a rel="external" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Antep_erased2.png">original photograph</a>
      was taken there by Nevit Dilman and is now in the public domain.

  <h2>The Typography</h2>

      <p>

        The text of this site is set with <em>Function Pro</em>, which is based
        on the <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)">Futura typeface</a>
        designed by Paul Renner in <span class="oldstyle">1927</span>. Renner
        believed that modern typefaces should not be based on old designs. He
        took letter-forms down to the bare essentials, and built Futura with
        simple geometric shapes, such as the circle, the square, and the
        triangle. The result was a very modern-looking sans-serif, that, with
        the help of the Bauer Type Foundry of Frankfurt, Germany, became an
        enormous success.
