  <h2>The Zeugma Princess</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      The <em>Zeugma Princess</em> is our pet name for what is commonly
      referred to as the Gypsy Girl Mosaic fragment. Her eyes seem to convey
      some haunting tale, but she has no mouth to tell us the story. She was
      found in the ancient
      <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma,_Commagene">city of Zeugma</a>,
      located in the present-day Gaziantep province of Turkey. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Zeugma was named for its bridge of boats that enabled passage across the
      Euphrates. In Greek,
      <dfn title="zeugma"><a rel="external" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dzeu%3Dgma">zeugma</a></dfn>
      literally means <em>bridge</em> or <em>bond</em>. The city reached its
      heights of affluence during the period of Roman rule, which commenced in
      <span class="oldstyle">64</span><abbr>AD</abbr>. In <span
        class="oldstyle">256</span><abbr>AD</abbr>, the city was conquered and
      destroyed by
      <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_I">King Shapur I</a>
      of the Persian Empire.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      The mosaic is now on display at the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology.
      The <a rel="external" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Antep_erased2.png">original photograph</a>
      was taken there by Nevit Dilman and is now in the public domain.
