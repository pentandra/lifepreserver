    <p>

      We are currently evaluating the best way to do open business for
      Pentandra, and are really excited about the possibilities. A wide
      spectrum of "open" choices need to be made, and we are trying to find the
      right fit for us.

    </p>
    <p>

      Here are some principles that are important to us:

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Anyone can get involved</li>
      <li>Rewards based on actual achievement</li>
      <li>Self-organizing teams</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      We will be updating this page as we figure things out. In the meantime,
      let us know what you think in the discussion below or 
      <a href="/company/#contact">contact us</a> with any great ideas that you
      have.
