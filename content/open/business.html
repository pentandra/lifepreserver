      We are currently evaluating the best way to do open business for
      Pentandra, and are really excited about the possibilities. A wide
      spectrum of "open" choices need to be made, and we are trying to find the
      right fit for us. Obviously, financial systems and other sensitive
      information will not be open to the community, but we think there are
      many other areas of business that can be open, for example, software
      development and marketing projects.

      Here are some principles that are important to us:

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Anyone can get involved</li>
      <li>Rewards based on actual achievement</li>
      <li>Self-organizing teams</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      We will be updating this page as we figure things out. In the meantime,
      let us know what you think in the discussion below or 
      <a href="/company/#contact">contact us</a> with any great ideas that you
      have.
