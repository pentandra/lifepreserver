      Investing in a social business is a little like donating to a nonprofit,
      and a little like investing in a for-profit corporation. It takes the
      best of both worlds while delinking company ownership from personal
      financial gain and placing all stakeholders on the same playing field.

    </p>
    <p class="bigger">We call it donations on steroids.</p>

  <h2>Motivations</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      We believe strongly that the way to fix the current problems with
      research is by applying business methods and practices. We are working
      with economic systems here, people, and we need economic solutions. The
      problems have, in large part, been created and exacerbated by business
      and we need to fix them with business.

    </p>
    <p>

      So why are we solving these problems with social business instead of
      conventional for-profit business? Simply because what we're trying to fix
      is so fundamental---it's a social problem. It goes beyond creating a
      better journal or a cool new product. The problems with research permeate
      society. Social business, especially <a
        href="http://www.muhammadyunus.org/index.php/social-business/seven-principles">as
        defined by Muhammad Yunus</a>, gives us the best set of motivations for
      fixing these problems. 

    </p>
    <p>

      Investing in a social business provides no personal financial
      benefits---the return is purely social. Here's how it works: if you
      invest in a social business today, then after ten to twenty years or so
      you would get your money back---nothing more---while maintaining your
      ownership in the company. In other words, if you cared enough about <a
        title="Pentandra's mission" href="/company/#sec:mission">our
        mission</a> that you wanted to invest in us, you would essentially
      donate the growth of your investment money for a period of time to our
      mission. At the end of a predetermined amount of time you would get your
      money back and keep the stock of a company you care about! The stock then
      would still have voting power, but no personal monetary value.

    </p>
    <p>

      So why would an investor invest in a social business? There is something
      that happens to an investor when there is the complete abdication of
      financial profit. Selfishness and greed leave, and the investor becomes
      concerned completely with the company mission. Other motivations for
      being involved in the company come to the surface, and the investor feels
      part of the team and that they are part of something bigger than self.
