      Investing in a social business is a little like donating to a nonprofit,
      and a little like investing in a for-profit corporation. It takes the
      best of both worlds while delinking company ownership from personal
      financial gain and placing all stakeholders on the same playing field.

    </p>
    <p class="bigger">We call it donations on steroids.</p>

  <h2>Motivations</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      We believe strongly that the way to fix the current problems with
      research is by applying business methods and practices. We are working
      with economic systems here, people, and we need economic solutions. The
      problems have, in large part, been created and exacerbated by business
      and we need to fix them with business.

    </p>
    <p>

      So why are we solving these problems with social business instead of
      conventional for-profit business? Simply because what we're trying to fix
      is so fundamental---it's a social problem. It goes beyond creating a
      better journal or a cool new product. The problems with research permeate
      society. Social business, especially <a
        href="http://www.muhammadyunus.org/index.php/social-business/seven-principles">as
        defined by Muhammad Yunus</a>, gives us the best motivational toolset
      for solving these problems. 

    </p>
    <p>

      Investing in a social business provides no personal financial
      benefits---the return is purely social. Here's how it works: if you
      invest in a social business today, then after ten to twenty years or so
      you would get your original investment back all the while maintaining
      your ownership in the company. In other words, if you cared enough about
      <a title="Pentandra's mission" href="/company/#sec:mission">our
        mission</a> that you wanted to invest in us, you would essentially
      donate the growth on that investment for a period of time to the mission.
      At the end of a predetermined amount of time you would get your money
      back and keep the stock of a company you care about! The stock then would
      still have voting power, but no personal monetary value.

    </p>
    <p>

      We often get asked, "Why don't you become a nonprofit and give yourselves
      a nice salary?" Foundation grants seem like they would be nice, but can
      introduce a dole-like mentality in an organization. Grants are not
      sustainable. Dependence on them produces companies that get stuck at
      fixed sizes. They introduce the wrong incentives. We need to be able to
      pivot quickly to do whatever would further our mission the most and
      maximize our social impact in the world. Investors expect greatness and
      growth from a business and that the job will get done in an efficient,
      sustainable way. From our point of view, knowing that we need to pay back
      the investors someday changes company culture.    

    </p>
    <p>

      So why would an investor invest in a social business? There is something
      that happens to an investor when there is the complete abdication of
      financial profit. Selfishness and greed leave as the investor becomes
      focused completely on achieving the company mission. Altruistic
      motivations to help the world arise in the heart. The investor becomes
      part of the team and feels united in purpose in serving something greater
      than self.
