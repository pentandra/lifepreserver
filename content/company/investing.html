      Investing in a social business is investing directly to make the world a
      better place. Social business delinks ownership from personal financial
      gain and puts all the stakeholders on the same playing field.

  <h2>Motivations</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      We believe strongly that the way to fix the current problems with
      research is through business methods and practices. The problems exist
      because of business and we need to fix them with business. We are working
      with an economic system here and we need economic solutions.

    </p>
    <p>

      Social business, especially <a
        href="http://www.muhammadyunus.org/index.php/social-business/seven-principles">as
        defined by Muhammad Yunus</a>, give the best set of motivations for
      fixing these problems. 

    </p>

    As a social
    business, we go beyond that minimum legal requirement by establishing a
    non-dividend stock policy and reinvesting <span
      class="oldstyle">100%</span> of our profits in ways that will promote
    open research, build up the community, improve our products and services,
    or in some other way entirely---whatever will further <a
      href="#sec:mission">our mission</a> the most and maximize our social
    impact in the world.

        There is somethat that happens to an investor when there is the
        complete abdication of financial profit. Selfishness and greed leave,
        and the investor is concerned complete with the company mission. Other
        motivations for being involved in the company come to the surface, and
        the investor feels part of the team and like they are part of something
        bigger than themself.

      </p>

  vs non-profit

  Stakeholder value replaces the shareholder paradigm.

  the social business offers businesspeople an exciting opportunity to leverage
  their own business skills and creativity to solve social problems.

      <h3>The Exit</h3>

      <p>

        Legally, we're organized as a <a href="http://benefitcorp.net">benefit
          corporation</a>, which means that we're required to create a material
        positive impact on society and the environment. Yet we were not satisfied
        with the standard options for businesses set up to do good in the world.
        It seemed that many businesses started out doing good, but became
        corrupted as rounds of funding progressed.

      </p>
      <p>

        As we looked at other companies that started out well but then tanked,
        we realized the problem was the exit. We needed a way to exit that did
        not induce selfish remonstrations by investors. One aspect that we
        needed was for our business model to be structured around openness. But
        this was not enough to be sure that the future goodness of the company
        was somewhat guaranteed. It's all about motivations.
