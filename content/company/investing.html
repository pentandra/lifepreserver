      Investing in a social business is investing directly to make the world a
      better place. Social business delinks ownership from personal financial
      gain and puts all the stakeholders on the same playing field.

  <h2>Motivations</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      We believe strongly that the way to fix the current problems with
      research is through business methods and practices. We are working with
      economic systems here and we need economic solutions. The problems exist
      because of business and we need to fix them with business.

    </p>
    <p>

      So why are we solving these problems with a social business instead of a
      conventional for-profit business? Simply because what we're trying to fix
      is more fundamental. Research is a social problem---it goes beyond
      creating a better journal or a cool new product. The problems with
      research permeate society. Social business, especially <a
        href="http://www.muhammadyunus.org/index.php/social-business/seven-principles">as
        defined by Muhammad Yunus</a>, gives us the best set of motivations for
      fixing these problems. 

    </p>
    <p>

      Investing in a social business provides no personal financial
      benefits---the return is purely social. Here's how it works: if you
      invested in us today, after ten to twenty years or so you would 'get your
      money back' while maintaining ownership and a connection to the company.
      In other words, if you cared enough about <a title="Pentandra's mission"
        href="/company/#sec:mission">our mission</a> that you wanted to invest,
      you would be willing to donate the growth of your investment money for a
      period of time to our mission. At the end of a predetermined amount of
      time you would get your money back and keep the stock of a company you
      care about! The stock then would still have voting power, but no personal
      monetary value.

    </p>
    <p>

      So why would an investor invest in a social business? There is something
      that happens to an investor when there is the complete abdication of
      financial profit. Selfishness and greed leave, and the investor becomes
      concerned completely with the company mission. Other motivations for
      being involved in the company come to the surface, and the investor feels
      part of the team and that they are part of something bigger than self.
