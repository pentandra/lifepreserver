      <h3>Utah Individual Development Account Network</h3>

      <p>

        The first bit of seed money from the <a
          href="http://www.uidan.org/">Utah Individual Development Account
          Network (<abbr>UIDAN</abbr>)</a> started us off. We had the idea of
        developing a cool tool for genealogical research, and our initial
        business plan was based solely around this idea. <abbr>UIDAN</abbr>
        worked with us to perfect this business plan, and we were able to raise
        enough money to get organized and start working.

      <h3>Anonymous Donor #1</h3>

      <p>

        Shortly after the <a href="/blog/success-in-failure/">Grow America
          Competition</a> in <span class="oldstyle">2012</span>, we received an
        anonymous donation. We blog about it <a
          href="/blog/unexpected-surprises/">here</a>. Among other things, we
        were able to invite more beta testers for Geungle and introduce <a
          href="/blog/open-business-open-booth/">Open Booth Chats</a> at an
        <abbr title="National Genealogical Society">NGS</abbr> conference in
        Cincinnati, Ohio.
