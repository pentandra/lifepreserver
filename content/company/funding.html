      <h3>Utah Individual Development Account Network</h3>

      <p>

        The first bit of seed money from the <a
          href="http://www.uidan.org/">Utah Individual Development Account
          Network</a> started us off. We had the idea of developing a cool tool
        for genealogical research, and our initial business plan was based
        solely around this idea. 
        <abbr title="Utah Individual Development Account Network">UIDAN</abbr>
        worked with us to perfect this business plan, and we were able to raise
        enough money to get organized and start working.

      <h3>Anonymous Donor #1</h3>

      <p>

        We were a finalist in the <span class="oldstyle">2012</span> Grow
        America Competition. Even though  <a
          href="/blog/success-in-failure/">we didn't win</a>, we received an <a
          href="/blog/unexpected-surprises/">anonymous donation shortly
          afterwards</a>. With these funds we were able, among other things, to
        invite more beta testers for Geungle and introduce <a
          href="/blog/open-business-open-booth/">Open Booth Chats</a> at an
        <abbr title="National Genealogical Society">NGS</abbr> conference in
        Cincinnati, Ohio.

      <h3>Anonymous Donor #2</h3>

      <p>

        We received another anonymous donation that carried us through a number
        of pivots. As we worked on <a href="/products/#geungle">Geungle</a> we
        realized that much of what we were doing was domain agnostic. We
        broadened our vision, and started learning about the bigger research
        community, including attending <a
          href="/blog/heading-to-oai8/"><abbr>OAI8</abbr></a> in Geneva,
        Switzerland, and building on the work of the <a
          href="/blog/w3c-web-annotation-wg/">web annotation community</a>.

        This helped us get to FORCE2015 to present <a
          href="/blog/introducing-research-cases/">our vision</a> of the future
        of research. Thanks for believing in what we're doing, mom and dad!
