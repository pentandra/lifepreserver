      <h3>Utah Individual Development Account Network</h3>

      <p>

        The first bit of seed money from the <a property="schema:agent"
          typeof="schema:Organization" href="http://www.uidan.org/"><span
            property="schema:name">Utah Individual Development Account
            Network</span></a> started us off. We had the idea of developing a
        cool tool for genealogical research, and our initial business plan was
        based solely around this idea.  <abbr title="Utah Individual
          Development Account Network">UIDAN</abbr> worked with us to perfect
        this business plan, and we were able to raise enough money to get
        organized and start working.

      <h3>Anonymous Donor #1</h3>

      <p>

        We were a finalist in the <span class="oldstyle">2012</span> Grow
        America Competition. Even though  <a
          href="/blog/success-in-failure/">we didn't win</a>, we received an <a
          href="/blog/unexpected-surprises/">anonymous donation shortly
          afterwards</a>. With these funds we were able, among other things, to
        invite more beta testers for Geungle and introduce <a
          href="/blog/open-business-open-booth/">Open Booth Chats</a> at an
        <abbr title="National Genealogical Society">NGS</abbr> conference in
        Cincinnati, Ohio.

      <h3>Anonymous Donor #2</h3>

      <p>

        We received another anonymous donation that carried us through a number
        of pivots. As we worked on <a href="/products/#geungle">Geungle</a> we
        realized that much of what we were doing was domain agnostic. We
        broadened our vision, and started learning about the bigger research
        community, including attending <a
          href="/blog/heading-to-oai8/"><abbr>OAI8</abbr></a> in Geneva,
        Switzerland, and building on the work of the <a
          href="/blog/w3c-web-annotation-wg/">web annotation community</a>.

        This helped us get to FORCE2015 to present <a
