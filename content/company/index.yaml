  - name: Amateur Researchers
    problem: >
      Amateurs research for the love of it, but are often excluded from
      participation in research collaborations because barriers are set
      arbitrarily high.
    solution:
  - name: Professional Researchers
    problem: > 
      Researchers are stuck in a corrupt, backwards system that they can't
      escape from without sacrificing their careers. Fierce competition too
      often leads to fraud, and sometimes even suicide.  Bad research gets
      published and good research doesn't. Negative results are often not
      considered 'a contribution to science' and do not get published, even
      though they comprise <span class="oldstyle">99%</span> of the research
      process and would be very useful to others.

    problem: >
      Research is inaccessible to the people that need it most. Research
      remains locked away in researchersâ€™ minds and proprietary systems.
      Research papers are often stuck behind paywalls.

  - name: Students
    problem: >
      Research and education are separate, but are part of the same cycle and
      should be integrated. Students should be focusing more on critical
      thinking and less on test scores.

      While publishers are enjoying record profits, libraries increasingly
      cannot afford the soaring journal prices.
