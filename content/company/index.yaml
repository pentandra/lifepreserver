  - name: Amateur Researchers
    problem: >
      Amateurs research for the love of it, but are often excluded from
      participation in research collaborations because they are not
      professionals. Yet amateurs represent the great untapped potential of the
      future of research.
    solution:

  - name: Professional Researchers
    problem: > 
      Researchers are stuck in a corrupt, backwards system that they can't
      escape from without sacrificing their careers. Fierce competition too
      often leads to fraud, and sometimes worse. Bad research gets published
      and good research doesn't. Negative results are often not considered 'a
      contribution to science' and do not get published, even though they make
      up ninety-nine percent of research results and would be very useful to
      others.

    problem: >
      Research is inaccessible to the people that need it most. Research
      remains locked away in researchersâ€™ minds and proprietary systems.
      Research papers are often stuck behind paywalls. We all need knowledge
      and research to be more accessible to the public.
    solution:

  - name: Students and Educators
    problem: >
      Research and education are currently thought of as separate things, but
      they are part of the same cycle and should be integrated. Critical
      thinking needs to be emphasized over test scores and straitjacket
      curricula.
    solution:

  - name: Developing Researchers in Developing Societies
    problem: >
      Researchers often do not understand the power, opportunities, and
      capacity they have to solve social problems in their own societies.
    solution:

  - name: Libraries
    problem: >
      While publishers are enjoying record profits, libraries increasingly
      cannot afford the soaring journal prices.
    solution:

    problem: >
      We can tackle big problems of society much more efficiently if we
      understand the nature of the problems we face. Research collaborations
      that span organizations are key to this understanding.
    solution:

  - name: Funders and Fundees
    problem: > 
      Government funding of research is a relatively new invention. While it
      works great for big science, it is too slow and burdensome for most
      research projects. 
    solution:

  - name: Publishers
    problem: >
      Publishers get a bad rap, but they are trying to fill a real need in the
      research ecosystem. In many ways they are trapped just as much as
      professional researchers are.
