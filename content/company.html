  <h2>Our Values</h2>

  <section>

    <h3>We Love Good Research.</h3>

    <p>
      We figure that if you're going to spend the time and money to do research,
      you might as well do it right. We want to help. And after you've done great
      research, we want to help you share it and show it off. (You want to show
      it off after you've put all that work into it, don't you?)
    </p>

  <section id="wearehereforyou">
    <h3>We Are Here For You</h3>

    <p>
      We believe that software should work the way researchers work, not the
      other way around. We are here to simplify your research experience. Please
      let us know how we can serve you better! Really. We want to know.
    </p>

  <section id="weresmall">
    <h3>We're Small</h3>

    <p>
      And we like it that way. Being small helps us to move faster and be more
      responsive to the needs of our customers.

  <section id="welovecommunity">
    <h3> We Love Community</h3>

    <p>
      Our company would not be here without the contributions from many in the
      technological and genealogical communities. We are happy to have a chance
      to contribute back.

  <section id="motherofinvention">
    <h3>The Mother Of Invention</h3>

    <p>
      Our company came about because we wanted to keep track of our own family
      history research. We hunted for software that would help us with it. We
      couldn't find any. So we decided to do it ourselves, and here we are!
