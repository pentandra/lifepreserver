  <h3>We Are Here For You</h3>

  <p>
    We believe that software should work the way researchers work, not the
    other way around. We are here to simplify your research experience. Please
    let us know how we can serve you better! Really. We want to know.

  <h3>We're Small</h3>

  <p>
    And we like it that way. Being small helps us to move faster and be more
    responsive to the needs of our customers.

  <h3> We Love Community</h3>

  <p>
    Our company would not be here without the contributions from many in the
    technological and genealogical communities. We are happy to have a chance
    to contribute back.

  <h3>The Mother Of Invention</h3>

  <p>
    Our company came about because we wanted to keep track of our own family
    history research. We hunted for software that would help us with it. We
    couldn't find any. So we decided to do it ourselves, and here we are!
