  <h2>Our Values</h2>

  <section id="passionate" class="item bl section">

    <h3>Passionate</h3>

    <p>

      Some people call it <abbr title="Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr>;
      others call it passion. We love good research. We want to make it easier
      to do good research. We believe that software should work the way
      researchers work, not the other way around. That is what drives
      us---crazy.

    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="quality" class="item bl ock section">

    <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>

    <p>

      We figure that if you're going to spend the time to do research, you
      might as well do it right. We want to make it easier for you to do <%=
      link_to('good research', '/research/') %>. And after you've done a great
      job, we want to help you show it off. <i>(You know you want to.)</i>

    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="smallandfocused" class="item bl section">

    <h3>Small And Focused</h3>

    <p>

      We're small...and we like it that way. Being small helps us to move
      faster and be more responsive to the needs of our customers. It also
      helps us keep our expenses down. Even when we cross the divide from a
      struggling startup to a profitable company (hopefully sooner than later)
      we want to stay small and connected.

    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="dogfood" class="item bl ock section">

    <h3>We Eat Our Own Dogfood</h3>

    <p>

      Necessity is the mother of invention. At least it was for us. We're
      genealogy junkies and needed something that would help us keep track of
      our family history research. In our hunt, what we found was a surprising
      lack of software that really understood the research process (in
      genealogy or any other research field). So we decided to make it
      ourselves. We thought it would be selfish not to share it, so here we
      are!

    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="committed" class="item bl section">

    <h3>Committed</h3>

    <p>

      We are committed to making research easier. This is our primary
      objective. We also want to keep data open. To do this we are building on
      open standards. We are trying to accomplish something great. We are
      determined to see it through---for the long haul.

    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="open" class="item bl ock section">

    <h3>Open</h3>

    <p>

      Openness is all about collaboration. For us, this means open research,
      open source, and an open business model. We wouldn't be here without the
      open contributions from many in the technological and genealogical
      communities. We are happy to have a chance to
      <%= link_to "contribute back", "/open/" %>.
      We invite you to join with us to build something amazing together.

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      We are a
      <%= link_to "social entrepreneurship", "/blog/a-social-business/" %>
      company with a mission to preserve and accelerate the process of
      research. This is a researcher-driven effort to shift the paradigm of
      research, remove barriers to knowledge dissemination, and make research
      more accessible to the world.

    </p>
    <p>

      True open access to research is currently held hostage by the limitations
      of the research paper publication paradigm. We want to empower
      researchers to preserve their entire research experience with
      <a href="/research#clarity">clarity</a>.
      Doing so enables researchers to
      <a href="/research#collaboration">collaborate</a> and publish their
      research in <a href="/research#context">context</a> throughout the
      research process.

    <div class="section img">
      <img class="retina" src="/images/logo.png" alt="Pentandra logo" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      We have set out to achieve this mission through the following means:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing open-source tools to make open, transparent, real-time,
        collaborative, cross-domain research possible.</li>
      <li>Promoting, creating, implementing open standards that further open
        research.</li>
      <li>Helping individuals and organizations transition to policies and
        incentives that reward open research, providing consulting services and
        technical support, when needed, similar to what <a
          href="http://bcorporation.net" rel="external">B Lab</a> has done for
        corporations.</li>
      <li>Promoting open research in general, it has benefits over enterprise,
        silo approaches.</li>
      <li>Lowering the barrier of entry for the common man and practitioners to
        participate in high-quality research projects, throughout the research
        process.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="bd">
    <p>

      We are a <a href="http://benefitcorp.net" rel="external">benefit
        corporation</a>, which basically means that we're legally required to
      create a material positive impact on society and the environment. We go
      beyond that minimum legal requirement by establishing a non-dividend
      stock policy and reinvesting <span class="oldstyle">100%</span> of our
      profits in ways that will promote open research, build up the community,
      improve our products and services, or in some other way
      entirely---whatever will further our mission the most and maximize our
      social impact in the world.
