      <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>

      <p>
        We love good research. We figure that if you're going to spend the time
        and money to do research, you might as well do it right. We've seen (and
        produced) enough bad research that we know it is worth doing things
        right, even if it takes longer. We want to make it easier for you to do
        good research. And after you've done a great job, we want to help you
        share it and show it off. (You want to show it off after you've put all 
        that work into it, don't you?)

      <h3>We're Small</h3>

      <p>
        And we like it that way. Being small helps us to move faster and be more
        responsive to the needs of our customers.

      <h3>The Mother Of Invention</h3>

      <p>
        Our company came about because we wanted to keep track of our own family
        history research. We hunted for software that would help us with it. We
        couldn't find any. So we decided to do it ourselves, and here we are!
      </p>

    <section id="committed">
      <h3>We Are Here For You</h3>

      <p>
        We believe that software should work the way researchers work, not the
        other way around. We are here to simplify your research experience. Please
        let us know how we can serve you better! Really. We want to know.

      <h3>We Love Community</h3>

      <p>
        Our company would not be here without the contributions from many in the
        technological and genealogical communities. We are happy to have a chance
        to contribute back.
