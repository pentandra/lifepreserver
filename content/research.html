  <h2>What is Research?</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      <span class="newthought">Research is a journey of discovery.</span> It is
      a process---the ultimate goal of which is to understand ourselves and the
      world around us. By nature, we are inquisitive. We want to know how
      things work. We have questions that beg for answers. Whenever we look for
      answers we are doing research, though we may not think of it as such.  In
      a sense, <em>all</em> of us are researchers, even if we don't realize it!

    </p>

    <p>

      Research is found in many fields, including science, engineering,
      history, anthropology, and humanities. Research is even found in our own
      homes when we're trying to decide which TV to buy. No matter where it is
      found, research is a process involving questions, hypotheses, study, and
      experimentation, arriving eventually at a provable conclusion. 

    </p>

          A <dfn>hypothesis</dfn> is an unverified answer to a research
          question.

      While we may come to a conclusion about which TV to buy using very
      <em>informal</em> research, some situations require a more
      <em>formal</em> approach. Formal research is just another way of saying
      credible research. Formal research contains features that help others
      believe the research conclusions, which usually involve opinion and need
      to be backed up with evidence.

  <h2>The Research Process</h2>

  <div class="bd">
    <p>

      The core of research is the research process. That's where all the cool
      stuff happens. The research process is made up of little building blocks
      that are put together in various ways as research progresses. These
      building blocks are grouped into meaningful units of research called
      cases. Cases start with a question and end with a conclusion. One of our
      goals is to make the research process, a.k.a. the journey of discovery,
      shareable. It's our passion.

    </p>
    <p>

      We've put together some of our thoughts about the research process to
      share with you. Whether you're a self-proclaimed research nerd or just
      getting started, come and acquaint yourself with what we are trying to
      accomplish.

    <h2>The Future of Research: A Manifesto</h2>

      <div class="bd">

        <p>

          In 1945, the Director of the US Office of Scientific Research and
          Development wrote:

        </p>

        <figure class="bq grab">
          <blockquote cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/">
            <p>

              Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the
              results of research are generations old and by now are totally
              inadequate for their purpose.
              
            </p>

        </figure>

        <p>

          This situation has not changed a whole lot since then. Yes, we have
          computers and digital documents now, but we are still stuck in the
          same publishing paradigm. It can still take one or two <em>years</em>
          to get a research paper published! And then, we only publish our
          research conclusions. While conclusions are important, research is
          more than conclusions. They are only a small part of the story. Most
          of our research process is not being published and is being lost. 

        </p>
        <p>

          Why is our sharing process still so limited? Why do we limit
          scholarly papers to the question and answer, when sharing the entire
          journey of discovery would be more beneficial for everyone? Research
          is a rich experience that should be shareable. 

        </p>
        <p>

          Traditionally, universities and other large research organizations
          have contributed the vast majority of research to the world. While
          these organizations will continue to play a large role in the
          research of the future, we believe that modern research and
          e-research systems will lower the entry barrier for quality research
          contributions, making it possible for more people to contribute to
          high-quality research projects.

          While the research process across fields may seem very similar on the
          surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
          representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. To be
          most effective, research software needs to be designed specifically for
          the field it is trying to support. However, we think that the
          following three elements should be present in any modern research
          system:

            Like tesserae in a mosaic, the building blocks of research should
            be visible and connected so others can understand how you put the
            pieces together.

        Research should be clear and transparent. Every piece of information
        that contributed to the conclusion should be accessible. Research must
        clearly show not only <em>what</em> data was used, but <em>how</em> the
        data was used to answer the question.  Otherwise, subsequent
        researchers will not know how the pieces were put together. 

      </p>
      <p>

        Clarity is important not only so that others can understand and
        verify your research conclusions, but because you don't want to leave
        out your journey of discovery. This is the crux of research. Why are
        we leaving out the good stuff?

            Individual tesserae have no meaning until they are put into

        Our world grows increasingly compartmentalized. We pursue our
        specialization as if with blinders, trying to push forward progress in
        our chosen field. Modern researchers and research systems need to take
        a more holistic approach.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" rel="external">Systems thinkers</a>
        need to show how research in one field relates to research in another.
        We need bridge builders that can see the big picture and make
        connections between bodies of knowledge, subjects, and individual
        lives.

        Research is only correctly understood in its proper context. When that
        fuller context is considered, new avenues for research are opened and
        barriers are breached. Holes in the research, if any, are also
        revealed.

        Modern research and research systems are collaborative. The rewards of
        research collaboration outweigh any of the benefits of proprietary
        reward systems. Life is too short to be stuck in traditional research
        silos.

        There is still so much to learn about ourselves and our world. Because
        good research <a href="/research/process/#growingquestions">naturally proliferates</a>,
        there is no danger of running out of work to do. However, we will move
        faster and build better research as we work together.
