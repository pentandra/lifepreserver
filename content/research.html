<h1>What is Research?</h1>

<p>

  That may sound like a silly question. But sometimes we are so busy with
  research that we don't take the time to think about what research is.

  Research is more than a publication.

</p>
<p>

  Everything that you do to go from a question to an answer. Not only do you
  want to share your answer, but you want to share how you got there---your
  journey of discovery. Don't leave out the middle. meat. more rich Research is
  the process of discovery. A discovery of questions, of clues, and of ideas
  that grow together until answers are revealed. It is a cycle---a quest to
  understand self and the world around us. When you discover something new
  about the world, it doesn't just add to the world's knowledgebase, it changes
  you. A discovery is exhilarating. All you want to do is share it with others.

  Research has many forms in many fields, including science, engineering,
  history, anthropology, humanities, among others. In each of these domains,
  research is a process involving questions, hypotheses, study, and
  experimentation, arriving eventually at a provable conclusion. This process
  is not always linear, but oftentimes follows a seemingly random and cyclical
  pattern. One question often leads to more questions. and that they're all
  connected. This process continues until answers are found and questions are
  laid to rest.

  <h2>A Vision of Modern Research</h2>

  <section>

  should be a rich experience that should be sharable. Why are we still
  limited to the. Why is our sharing process still so limited? Why do we
  allow the scholarly papers to limit to the q and a, when sharing the whole
  process would be more beneficial for everyone?
    <p>
      Research has been around for centuries. While new tools have come into play,
      the research process itself hasn't changed a whole lot. Many in the 
      research community are calling for improvements in both the quality of the
      research and efficiency of the process.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      While the research process across fields may seem very similar on the
      surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
      representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. We 
      believe that to be most effective, research software needs to be 
      designed specifically for the field it is trying to support. We have
      discovered three elements that are essential in creating modern,
      domain-specific research systems: clarity, context, and collaboration.

    <h3>Clarity</h3>
    
    See what pieces you used and how you used it.
    <p>
      Research has to be understandable to be useful. Let's compare research
      to a puzzle. Unlike a puzzle that you buy from the store, this puzzle 
      box is unlabeled. You know that it makes a picture, but you don't know
      what that picture is. After you put the pieces together, someone else
      looking at what you did should be able to see the same thing
      you do, whether you have put the puzzle together correctly or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarity in research is being able to see the research from the original
      researcher's point of view. Research is more than conclusions;
      therefore, all of the pieces of information that were used to come to a
      conclusion need to be accessible and transparent. In addition, research
      must clearly show <em>how</em> the data was used to answer a question. 
      Otherwise, the researchers that come after will not know how you put
      the pieces together.
    </p>

  <h3>Context</h3>

  Seeing the big picture. What does this mean? How the picture fits into the
  greater body of knowledge, subject, all of humanity the world, or of an individual life.
  There are many contexts to consider. People may be working on similar
  things in different specializations that need to step back and see past the
  compartments. life context, research context. How does this affect me and
  the world? How does the world affect my research, and how does my research
  affect the world? Computer needs to understand how things are related, even
  if they are in different fields. cross-?
    <p>
      Individual pieces of a puzzle have no meaning until they are put in
      context.  You don't pick one puzzle piece out of the box and expect to
      see the whole picture. As you add pieces, however, a picture begins to
      emerge and you can see the true meaning of each piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research is only correctly understood in its proper context. This means
      studying not only the subject of the research, but also how it relates
      to the world around it. When that fuller context is considered, new
      avenues for research are opened and barriers are breached. Holes
      in the research, if any, are also revealed.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>

    <div class="bd">
    Being able to share the whole process. Builds upon clarity and context.
    Sharing a simple answer is hollow. 42. Share during the process, not just
    when we are done. Share all along the way. Being able to evaluate someone
    else's research, because the research is open and transparent. Link to open
    research. Make our world a better place by working together instead of
    fighting all the time. Can you imagine what that would be like? There is
    too much to figure out; we can't do it all on our own.
      <p>
        Putting a complicated puzzle together with friends is much quicker and
        more enjoyable than tackling it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of us is as smart as all of us. Sharing just one piece, even the conclusion, is not enough.
        This gives peer review a new meaning.
