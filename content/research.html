  <h2>What is Research?</h2>

  <div class="bd fx">

    <p class="normal">

      That may sound like a silly question. But sometimes we don't consider
      what research really is. It could be that research can seem so intuitive.
      By nature, we are inquisitive. We want answers to our questions. Every
      time we try to find an answer we are doing research. We just may not
      think of it as such. <em>All</em> of us are researchers, even if we don't
      realize it!

    </p>
    <p>

      So what is research, then?

    </p>
    <p>

      Research is the process of discovery. It is a cycle---a quest to
      understand ourselves and the world around us. Research is found in many
      fields, including science, engineering, history, anthropology,
      humanities. It is even found in our own homes when we're trying to decide
      which TV to buy. In each of these domains, research is a process
      involving questions, hypotheses, study, and experimentation, arriving
      eventually at a provable conclusion.

  <h2>The In's and Out's of Research</h2>
  
  <div class="section">
    <div class="bd fx">

      <p class="normal">
        
        Research is an outward expansion of knowledge and understanding. When
        we learn something new, we feel enlightened. We want to share our new
        understanding with the world. If you have ever discovered something,
        you know what I am talking about.

      </p>
      <p>
        
        An inward perspective is also needed in research. We look back and
        evaluate our progress, making sure that we have not strayed from the
        path and that we have not left any stone unturned. Peer review gives us
        a second opinion as others look back on our research to assess its
        quality.

      </p>
      <p>

        To make these in's and out's more manageable we need a few more tools.
        Large research problems can be overwhelming. It is easier to break up
        large problems into bite-sized pieces. We can then work on one smaller
        piece of research at a time without drowning. Likewise, as we look
        backwards and evaluate our own research, we need a measuring stick to
        measure the quality of what we have accomplished.

      <h3>A Unit of Research</h3>

      <p>

        So how do we break these large research problems into smaller pieces?
        What is research made of? Like scientists break down matter into atoms,
        we need to find the fundamental unit of research. We know that
        questions and answers are the beginning and end of the research
        process, so a question and an answer frame a unit of research. All of
        the good stuff, your journey of discovery, is sandwiched in between.
        We call the whole thing, both frame and filling, a <em>case</em>.
        Whenever we have a question, we start a case. This case keeps track of
        everything we have done to find an answer to that question. It is a
        little bundle of research.

      </p>
      <p>

        This idea of case study research is common in social, educational, and
        political research. Dr. Gary Thomas of the University of Birmingham has
        described case studies as follows:

      </p>

      <figure class="bq grab">
        <blockquote cite="http://qix.sagepub.com/content/17/6/511">
          <p>

            Case studies are analyses of persons, events, decisions, periods,
            projects, policies, institutions, or other systems that are studied
            holistically by one or more methods.
            
          </p>

      </figure>

      <p>

        Cases are the building blocks of research. Once you have built a case,
        other cases can be built on top of it. Cases can be grouped into
        projects. Cases are autonomous, and can be shared with others, allowing
        others to see not only the conclusion, but how you got there.

    <h2>A Vision of Modern Research</h2>

      <div class="bd">

      should be a rich experience that should be sharable. Why are we still
      limited to the. Why is our sharing process still so limited? Why do we
      allow the scholarly papers to limit to the q and a, when sharing the whole
      process would be more beneficial for everyone?

        <p>

          Research has been around for centuries. While new tools have come
          into play, the research process itself hasn't changed a whole lot.
          Many in the research community are calling for improvements in both
          the quality of the research and efficiency of the process.

        </p>
      
        <p>
          
          Much of this process gets lost in the current publication paradigm.
          Research is more than a publication.
        
        </p>

        <p>

          While the research process across fields may seem very similar on the
          surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
          representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. We 
          believe that to be most effective, research software needs to be 
          designed specifically for the field it is trying to support. We have
          discovered three elements that are essential in creating modern,
          domain-specific research systems: clarity, context, and collaboration.

        </p>

      <h3>Clarity</h3>
      
      See what pieces you used and how you used it.
      <p>
        Research has to be understandable to be useful. Let's compare research
        to a puzzle. Unlike a puzzle that you buy from the store, this puzzle 
        box is unlabeled. You know that it makes a picture, but you don't know
        what that picture is. After you put the pieces together, someone else
        looking at what you did should be able to see the same thing
        you do, whether you have put the puzzle together correctly or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarity in research is being able to see the research from the original
        researcher's point of view. Research is more than conclusions;
        therefore, all of the pieces of information that were used to come to a
        conclusion need to be accessible and transparent. In addition, research
        must clearly show <em>how</em> the data was used to answer a question. 
        Otherwise, the researchers that come after will not know how you put
        the pieces together.
      </p>

    <p>

      Not only do you
      want to share your answer, but you want to share how you got there---your
      journey of discovery. Don't leave out the middle. meat. more rich

    </p> 
    <p>

      This process is not always linear, but oftentimes follows a
      seemingly random and cyclical pattern. One question often leads to more
      questions. and that they're all connected. This process continues until
      answers are found and questions are laid to rest.

          The outcome of any serious research can only be to make two
          questions grow where only one grew before.

      <h3>Context</h3>

      Seeing the big picture. What does this mean? How the picture fits into the
      greater body of knowledge, subject, all of humanity the world, or of an individual life.
      There are many contexts to consider. People may be working on similar
      things in different specializations that need to step back and see past the
      compartments. life context, research context. How does this affect me and
      the world? How does the world affect my research, and how does my research
      affect the world? Computer needs to understand how things are related, even
      if they are in different fields. cross-?
        <p>
          Individual pieces of a puzzle have no meaning until they are put in
          context.  You don't pick one puzzle piece out of the box and expect to
          see the whole picture. As you add pieces, however, a picture begins to
          emerge and you can see the true meaning of each piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research is only correctly understood in its proper context. This means
          studying not only the subject of the research, but also how it relates
          to the world around it. When that fuller context is considered, new
          avenues for research are opened and barriers are breached. Holes
          in the research, if any, are also revealed.

      <h3>Collaboration</h3>

      Being able to share the whole process. Builds upon clarity and context.
      Sharing a simple answer is hollow. 42. Share during the process, not just
      when we are done. Share all along the way. Being able to evaluate someone
      else's research, because the research is open and transparent. Link to open
      research. Make our world a better place by working together instead of
      fighting all the time. Can you imagine what that would be like? There is
      too much to figure out; we can't do it all on our own.
        <p>
          Putting a complicated puzzle together with friends is much quicker and
          more enjoyable than tackling it alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of us is as smart as all of us. Sharing just one piece, even the conclusion, is not enough.
          This gives peer review a new meaning.
