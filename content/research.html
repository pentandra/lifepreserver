    <h2>What is Research?</h2>
    <p>
      Research is a process of discovery. A discovery of questions, of clues, 
      and of ideas that grow together until answers are revealed. It is a
      cycle---a quest to understand self and the world around us. When you 
      discover something new about the world, it doesn't just add to the
      world's knowledgebase, it changes you. A discovery is exhilarating. All
      you want to do is share it with others. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Research has many forms in many fields, including science,
      engineering, history, anthropology, humanities, among others. In each of
      these domains, research is a process involving questions, 
      hypotheses, study, and experimentation, arriving eventually at a provable
      conclusion. This process is not always linear, but oftentimes
      follows a seemingly random and cyclical pattern. One question often leads 
      to more questions. This process continues until answers are found and 
      questions are laid to rest.

    <h2>Essential Elements of Modern Research</h2>
  
    <section>

      <p>
        Research has been around for centuries. While new tools have come into play,
        the research process itself hasn't changed a whole lot. Many in the 
        research community are calling for improvements in both the quality of the
        research and efficiency of the process.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        While the research process across fields may seem very similar on the
        surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
        representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. We 
        believe that to be most effective, research software needs to be 
        designed specifically for the field it is trying to support. We have
        discovered three elements that are essential in creating modern,
        domain-specific research systems: clarity, context, and collaboration.

      <h3>Clarity</h3>
      
      <p>
        Research has to be understandable to be useful. Let's compare research
        to a puzzle. Unlike a puzzle that you buy from the store, this puzzle 
        box is unlabeled. You know that it makes a picture, but you don't know
        what that picture is. After you put the pieces together, someone else
        looking at what you did should be able to see the same thing
        you do, whether you have put the puzzle together correctly or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarity in research is being able to see the research from the original
        researcher's point of view. Research is more than conclusions;
        therefore, all of the pieces of information that were used to come to a
        conclusion need to be accessible and transparent. In addition, research
        must clearly show <em>how</em> the data was used to answer a question. 
        Otherwise, the researchers that come after will not know how you put
        the pieces together.
      </p>

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        Individual pieces of a puzzle have no meaning until they are put in
        context.  You don't pick one puzzle piece out of the box and expect to
        see the whole picture. As you add pieces, however, a picture begins to
        emerge and you can see the true meaning of each piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research is only correctly understood in its proper context. This means
        studying not only the subject of the research, but also how it relates
        to the world around it. When that fuller context is considered, new
        avenues for research are opened and brick walls are surmounted. Holes
        in the research are also revealed.
      </p>

      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        Putting a complicated puzzle together with friends is much quicker and
        more enjoyable than tackling it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of us is as smart as all of us. Sharing just one piece, even the conclusion, is not enough.
        This gives peer review a new meaning.
