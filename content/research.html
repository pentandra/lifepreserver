  <h2>What is Research?</h2>

  <div class="bd fx">

    <p class="normal">

      Research is the process of discovery. It is a cycle---a quest to
      understand ourselves and the world around us. We are inquisitive by
      nature. We want to know how things work and to find answers to our
      questions. Whenever we are searching for answers we are doing research,
      though we may not think of it as such. We do it so often that it seems
      natural and intuitive. In a sense, <em>all</em> of us are researchers,
      even if we don't realize it!

    </p>

    <p>

      Research is found in many fields, including science, engineering,
      history, anthropology, and humanities. It is even found in our own homes
      when we're trying to decide which TV to buy. In each of these domains,
      research is a process involving questions, hypotheses, study, and
      experimentation, arriving eventually at a provable conclusion. 

    </p>

    <aside class="banner aside mod rev">
      <div class="pod">
        <p>

          A <dfn>hypothesis</dfn> is an unverified answer to a research
          question.  
          
        </p>
        <p>

          <a class="button" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis" rel="external">Hypothesis on <b>Wikipedia</b></a>

    <p>

      While we may come to a conclusion about which TV to buy using very
      <em>informal</em> research, some situations require a more
      <em>formal</em> approach. Formal research is just another way of saying
      credible research. When we are sharing research with others, formal
      research contains the features that will help others believe and
      understand our research conclusions.

    </p>
    <p>

      Traditionally, universities and other large research organizations have
      contributed the vast majority of research to the world. While these
      organizations will continue to play a large role in the research of the
      future, we believe that modern research and e-research systems will lower
      the entry barrier for quality research contributions.

  <h2>The Research Process</h2>
  
  <div class="section">
    <div class="bd">

      <p>
        
        Research is an outward expansion of knowledge and understanding. When
        we discover something new, we feel enlightened. We want to share our
        new understanding with the world. If you have ever discovered something
        new, you know what I mean.

      </p>
      <p>

        The research process is not always linear, but oftentimes follows a
        seemingly random and cyclical pattern. One question often leads to more
        questions. This process continues until answers are found and questions
        are laid to rest.

      </p>

            The outcome of any serious research can only be to make two
            questions grow where only one grew before.

      <p>
        
        An inward perspective is also needed in research. We look back and
        evaluate our progress, making sure that we have not strayed from the
        path and that we have not left any stone unturned. Peer review gives us
        a second opinion as others look back on our research to assess its
        quality.

      </p>
      <p>

        To make these in's and out's more manageable we need a few more tools.
        Large research problems can be overwhelming. If we break up these large
        problems into bite-sized pieces, research becomes more straightforward.
        Likewise, as we look backwards and evaluate our own research, we need a
        measuring stick to measure the quality of what we have accomplished.

      <h3>A Unit of Research</h3>

      <p>

        So how do we break these large research problems into smaller pieces?
        What is research made of? Like scientists that break down matter into
        atoms, we need to find the fundamental unit of research. We know that
        questions and answers are the beginning and end of the research
        process; therefore, a question and an answer frame a unit of research.
        All of the good stuff, your journey of discovery, is sandwiched in
        between.  We call the whole thing, both frame and filling, a
        <em>case</em>.  Whenever we have a question, we start a case. A case
        keeps track of everything we have done to find an answer to a
        question. It is a little bundle of research.

      </p>

      <p>

        Cases are the building blocks of research. Once a case has been built,
        other cases can be built on top of it. Cases can be grouped into
        projects. Cases can be shared with others, allowing others to see not
        only the conclusions, but the entire research process.

        The idea of case study research is common in social, educational, and
        political research. Dr. Gary Thomas of the University of Birmingham has
        described case studies as follows:

            Case studies are analyses of persons, events, decisions, periods,
            projects, policies, institutions, or other systems that are studied
            holistically by one or more methods.

    <h2>A Vision of Modern Research</h2>

      <div class="bd">

        <p>

          In 1945, the Director of the US Office of Scientific Research and
          Development said:

        </p>

        <figure class="bq grab">
          <blockquote cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/">
            <p>

              Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the
              results of research are generations old and by now are totally
              inadequate for their purpose.
              
            </p>

        </figure>

        <p>

          This situation has not changed a whole lot since then. Yes, we have
          computers and digital documents now, but we are still stuck in a
          paper publishing paradigm. It can still take one or two
          <em>years</em> to get a research paper published! And then, we still
          only publish our research conclusions. While conclusions are
          important, research is more than a conclusion. Much of our research
          process is not being published and is being lost. This makes it
          harder to build on each other's research.

        </p>
        <p>

          Why is our sharing process still so limited? Why do we limit
          scholarly papers to the question and answer, when sharing the entire
          journey of discovery would be more beneficial for everyone? Research
          is a rich experience that should be shareable. 

        </p>

        <p>

          While the research process across fields may seem very similar on the
          surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
          representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. We
          believe that to be most effective, research software needs to be
          designed specifically for the field it is trying to support. However,
          we think that the following three elements should be present in any
          modern research system:

            Like tesserae in a mosaic, the building blocks of research should
            be visible and accessible so others can understand how you put the
            pieces together.

        Research should be clear and transparent. All of the pieces of
        information that contributed to the conclusion should be accessible.
        We should be able to see the research from the original researcher's
        point of view. Research must clearly show not only <em>what</em> data
        was used, but <em>how</em> the data was used to answer the question.
        Otherwise, the researchers that come after will not know how you put
        the pieces together. 

      </p>
      <p>

        Clarity is important not only so that others can understand and
        verify your research conclusion, but because you don't want to leave
        out your journey of discovery. This is the "meat" of research. Why are
        we leaving out the good stuff?

        Research is only correctly understood in its proper context. When that
