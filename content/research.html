  <h2>What is Research?</h2>

    <p class="normal">

      <span class="newthought">Research is a journey of discovery.</span> It
      is a process---the ultimate goal of which is to understand ourselves and
      the world around us. By nature, we are each inquisitive. We want to know
      how things work. We have questions that beg for answers. Whenever we look
      for answers we are doing research, though we may not think of it as such.
      In a sense, <em>all</em> of us are researchers, even if we don't realize
      it!

    </p>

    <p>

      Research is found in many fields, including science, engineering,
      history, anthropology, and humanities. Research is even found in our own
      homes when we're trying to decide which TV to buy. No matter where it is
      found, research is a process involving questions, hypotheses, study, and
      experimentation, arriving eventually at a provable conclusion. 

    </p>

    <aside class="banner aside mod rev">

          A <dfn>hypothesis</dfn> is an unverified answer to a research

    <p>

      While we may come to a conclusion about which TV to buy using very
      <em>informal</em> research, some situations require a more
      <em>formal</em> approach. Formal research is just another way of saying
      credible research. Formal research contains features that help others
      believe the research conclusions, which usually involve opinion and need
      to be backed up with evidence.

    </p>
    <p>

      Traditionally, universities and other large research organizations have
      contributed the vast majority of research to the world. While these
      organizations will continue to play a large role in the research of the
      future, we believe that modern research and e-research systems will lower
      the entry barrier for quality research contributions, making it possible
      for more people to contribute to high-quality research projects.

  <h2>The Research Process</h2>

    <div class="bd fx">

      <p class="normal">

        So, how do you learn how to research? In order to answer that question
        we need to take a closer look at the research <em>process</em>.
        Research is messy. To an outside observer, research may even look a bit
        like chaos theory. Even so, a good researcher is fully aware of the
        research process and knows exactly what is going on and why.

      </p>

      <nav>
        <p>

          Let's take a journey through the research process. First, we'll take 
          a drive through the <a href="#io">inputs and outputs</a>.
          Then, we'll stop by the <a href="#phases">phases</a> of the research
          process. After that, we'll define <a href="#unit">the fundamental unit</a> 
          of research. And finally we'll visit the <a href="#proof">pillars of proof</a>.
          While the research process can vary a lot depending on the field of
          research, this journey should at least give you a good intro to the
          fundamentals.

        </p>
      </nav>

      <p>

        Before we can start our journey, however, we need a question. Questions
        are always the beginning of the research process. Conclusions are the
        end. All of the good stuff---the journey of discovery---is sandwiched
        in-between. Only after we have a question can we try to find an answer!

      <p class="normal">

        The easiest things to grasp when talking about the research process are
        the tangible things--the things that we can see, touch, read and write.
        These are the things we are left with after completing some phase of
        the research process. 

      </p>
      <p>
        
        In research, one thing flows into another. As <a href="#fig:outputs">Figure 2</a>
        shows, an output from one phase is the input for another. These inputs
        and outputs do not follow some predetermined path, but rather are
        dependent on the of the previous phase of the research process.

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Data</dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Raw, uninterpreted stuff. Given a field of research, data is the
            source from which researchers in that field gather information.

          </p>
          
          <p>

            Could include measurements made during experiments by a physicist
            or historical documents for a genealogist or historian. This can
            even include research papers that are studied during the course of
            research. 

          </p>

        <dt>Information</dt>

          This is interpreted data. It should be understood by someone that is

      <h3>Phases: The "How's" of Research</h3>

    <div class="bd fx">

      <p class="normal">

        Research is a lot like chess. Strategy is required to assemble the bits
        of information the right way. 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          
          <b>Orientation</b>--assessing the situation and orienting to the possibilities

        </li>
        <li><b>Exploration</b>--Trying out some of the possibilities</li>
        <li><b>Investigation</b>--Digging deeper and choosing the best possibility</li>
        <li><b>Proof</b>--Confirming that the choice is right</li>
        
      </ol>

      <p>

        Oftentimes, we can cycle through these phases in a matter of seconds.
        Sometimes it takes longer. It depends on the problem at hand.

      </p>
      <p>

        While chess has a very finite number of possibilities, research is
        dynamic with almost limitless possibilities. Unlike chess, you discover
        the rules and the playing pieces as you go along. However, just like
        chess, your eventual placement in the game is the sum of all the
        previous moves you have made on the game board.

      </p>

      <p>

        These inputs and outputs point the way in research like a compass
        points the way through an overgrown forest.

        Like scientists that break matter down into atoms, we need to isolate a
        unit of research so that research can be more manageable.

      </p>
      <p>

        To make these in's and out's more manageable we need a few more tools.
        Large research problems can be overwhelming. If we break up these large
        problems into bite-sized pieces, research becomes more straightforward.
        Likewise, as we look backwards and evaluate our own research, we need a
        measuring stick to measure the quality of what we have accomplished.

        In our software systems we call this whole thing a <em>case</em>. A

        question. Think of it as a little bundle of research.

        The idea of case study research is common in social, educational, and
        political research. Dr. Gary Thomas of the University of Birmingham has
        described case studies as follows:

            Case studies are analyses of persons, events, decisions, periods,
            projects, policies, institutions, or other systems that are studied
            holistically by one or more methods.

      <p>

        Cases are the building blocks of research. Once a case has been built,
        other cases can be built on top of it. Cases can be grouped into
        projects. Cases can be shared with others, allowing others to see not
        only the conclusions, but the entire research process.

      </p>

      <p>

        The research process is not always linear, but oftentimes follows a
        seemingly random and cyclical pattern. One question often leads to more
        questions. This process continues until answers are found and questions
        are laid to rest.

      <p class="normal">

        So after we have done some research, how do we know how good it is? We
        know by looking back and comparing what we have done to a standard. The
        standard varies depending on the domain, but generally includes the
        following checkpoints:

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Attribution</dt>
        <dd>
          Don't be a weasel. Did I give credit where credit is due?
        </dd>
        <dt>Comprehensive</dt>
        <dd>
          Research should be thorough. Did I cover all my bases? 
        </dd>
        <dt>Well-Reasoned</dt>
        <dd>
          Think about it. Does the conclusion make sense logically?
        </dd>
        <dt>Verifiable</dt>
        <dd>
          Can someone else retrace my steps? Will they end up at the same place
          I did?
        </dd>
        <dt>Transparent</dt>
        <dd>
          Don't hide your light under a bushel. Explain what you mean so that
          someone else can understand it.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        
        An inward perspective is also needed in research. We look back and
        evaluate our progress, making sure that we have not strayed from the
        path and that we have not left any stone unturned. Peer review gives us
        a second opinion as others look back on our research to assess its
        quality.

      </p>

      <p>

        All research conclusions involve opinion. It is up to you, as a
        researcher, to prove that your opinion is right.

          In 1945, the Director of the US Office of Scientific Research and
          Development said:

        </p>

        <figure class="bq grab">
          <blockquote cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/">

              Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the
              results of research are generations old and by now are totally
              inadequate for their purpose.

        </figure>

        <p>

          This situation has not changed a whole lot since then. Yes, we have
          computers and digital documents now, but we are still stuck in a
          paper publishing paradigm. It can still take one or two
          <em>years</em> to get a research paper published! And then, we still
          only publish our research conclusions. While conclusions are
          important, research is more than a conclusion. Most of our research
          process is not being published and is being lost. This makes it
          harder to build on each other's research.

        </p>
        <p>

          Why is our sharing process still so limited? Why do we limit
          scholarly papers to the question and answer, when sharing the entire
          journey of discovery would be more beneficial for everyone? Research
          is a rich experience that should be shareable. 

        </p>

        <p>

          While the research process across fields may seem very similar on the
          surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
          representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. We
          believe that to be most effective, research software needs to be
          designed specifically for the field it is trying to support. However,
          we think that the following three elements should be present in any
          modern research system:

            Like tesserae in a mosaic, the building blocks of research should

        Research should be clear and transparent. All of the pieces of
        information that contributed to the conclusion should be accessible.
        We should be able to see the research from the original researcher's
        point of view. Research must clearly show not only <em>what</em> data
        was used, but <em>how</em> the data was used to answer the question.
        Otherwise, the researchers that come after will not know how you put
        the pieces together.

        Clarity is important not only so that others can understand and
        verify your research conclusion, but because you don't want to leave

        Modern research and research systems are collaborative. The rewards of
        research collaboration outweigh any of the benefits of traditional
        reward systems. Life is too short to be stuck in traditional research
        silos.

         There is still so much to learn about ourselves and our world. Because
         good research <a href="#growingquestions">naturally proliferates</a>,
         there is no danger of running out of work to do. However, we will move
         faster and build better research as we work together.
