<h1>An Open Approach</h1>

<p>

  Everyone knows that many hands make light work. 
  Open is the way to make the most progress. Closed solutions may produce some
  short-term gains, but open makes the most long-term sense. In order to reap
  the rewards of collaboration, we need to be willing to share what we are
  doing.

  <h2>Open Research</h2>

  S: Speed of discovery. Future research will be based on solid ground. We will
  never run out of researchable stuff
  W: Some people just want to keep it to themselves for various reasons.
  Privacy. We want to encourage openness.
  O: The internet. mobile devies. wireless internet.
  T: Publishers that don't do anything except publish and lock up other
  people's research for money. They don't just not add value, they remove value.

    This is called

  <h2>Open Source</h2>

  S: Community can benefit from and improve a common code base. We have
  benefited ourselves from many open-source projects and we want to give back
  and make the world a better place.
  W: Someone could take it and use it and compete with us? Some things are
  better NOT open-sourced. Imagine if twitter open-sourced their platform and
  everyone and his dog hosted their own twitter network. How useful would that
  be? It just doesn't make sense. Parts dealing with collaboration need to be
  centralized, or at least federated.

    We believe the future of software is open source. We are involved in
    several open source projects

  <h2>Open Business</h2>

  S: We are truly connected to the community. We can better tailor our efforts
  to them, not to what we think they want. Gives the community skin in the game
  and a willingness to give back so we can work together. There can be
  understanding between us and our customers.
  W: Fighting about stuff. Slow decisions. If we don't make it completely open,
  it won't feel open. We need someone to make the final call.
  O: Respect and us an opportunity to respect them as we work together.
  T: Someone chooses not to show respect. That hurts the whole group.

  <p>

    We are in business to help make your research easier. We figure that if you
    are not happy with what we are doing, we are doing something wrong. We
    think the best way to keep our customers happy is to involve them in some
    of our business decisions. You may say, "Isn't that supposed to be secret?"
    Well, we have thought a lot about that. We have come to the conclusion that
    we will be a better company if we are transparent and involve our customers
    in the decision-making process. With modern technology, why not do it this
    way? It's an experiment. We don't know how well it will work, but we think
    it will be great.

    We can't please everyone, but by <a href="#opensource">open-sourcing</a>
    other needs can be met by the community.
