  <h1>An <span class="excl">Open</span> Approach</h1>

  <p class="normal">

    We live in a world that is very interdependent. From a very young age we all
    need to learn how to collaborate. sports team, orchestra

    The real purpose of an open approach is to enable collaboration.

    Everyone knows that many hands make light work. Open is the way to make the
    most progress. Closed solutions may have some short-term gains, but open
    makes the most long-term sense. In order to reap the rewards of an open
    approach, we need to be willing to share what we are doing.

      The future of research is open. Open research involves collaboration
      throughout the research process, not just at the end when conclusions are
      written. Better conclusions can be reached more quickly when researchers
      from different backgrounds and locations work together in a spirit of
      mutual cooperation. Transparency throughout the research process allows
      other researchers to assess the true nature and caliber of a research
      project and even build on top of it. Just consider the possibilities!

  <h2>Open Source</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      Open-source software is software whose source code is freely available to
      the public, enabling the use, reuse, and improvement of that code. It also
      refers to a philosophy of collaborative development. We are supporters of
      open-source software. Our entire infrastructure is built upon it. We plan
      to contribute much of the source code that we write to the community. We
      hope that others will benefit from this code and contribute back!

  <h2>Open Business</h2>

    <p>

      We are in business to help make research easier. We figure if we are not
      doing that, we are doing something wrong. It is more likely that we will
      get it right if we learn from the principles of open research and open
      source and involve the community in our business development. Many in the
      community may have more experience or different perspectives than we do.
      It would be foolish to ignore this wealth of knowledge, ideas, and
      experience as we try to meet the needs of that community. No man is an
      island, and a business that isolates itself from its customers can't
      effectively give them what they need or want.

    </p>
    <p>

      We have a vision for <%= link_to "the future of research", "/research/" %>.
      We propose an experiment. The hypothesis: We are more likely to attain
      this vision for research by opening the doors of knowledge,
      communication, and understanding between us and the community, than by
      maintaining tight-lipped corporate secrecy. 
      
    </p>
    <p>

      It's an experiment. We don't know how well it will work, but we think it
      will be great! No specific resume is required. ;) Please come and get
      involved!
