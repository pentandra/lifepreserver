<h1>An Open Approach</h1>

<p>

  The real purpose of an open approach is to enable collaboration.

  Everyone knows that many hands make light work. Open is the way to make the
  most progress. Closed solutions may have some short-term gains, but open
  makes the most long-term sense. In order to reap the rewards of an open
  approach, we need to be willing to share what we are doing.

  <h2>Open Research</h2>

  <p>

    Open is the future of research. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research" rel="external">Open research</a>
    involves collaboration throughout the research process, not just at the end
    when the conclusions are written. It is done in a spirit of mutual
    cooperation. Researchers from different locations and backgrounds work
    together and come to better conclusions more quickly. Transparency allows
    others to view the true nature and caliber of another's research and even
    build on top of it.

  <h2>Open Source</h2>

  <p>

    Source code that is open and available to be used freely will be improved
    upon more often than the closed alternative. We are strong supporters of
    open-source software. Our entire infrastructure is built upon it. We
    contribute much of the source code that we write to the community as well.
    We hope that others can benefit from this code and contribute back!

  <h2>Open Business</h2>

  <p>

    We are in business to help make your research easier. We figure that if you
    are not happy with what we are doing, we are doing something wrong. We
    think the best way to keep our customers happy is to involve them in some
    of our business decisions. You may say, "Isn't that supposed to be secret?"
    Well, we have thought a lot about that. We have come to the conclusion that
    we will be a better company if we are transparent and involve our customers
    in the decision-making process. With modern technology, why not do it this
    way? It's an experiment. We don't know how well it will work, but we think
    it will be great.

  <p>

    We can't please everyone, but by <a href="#opensource">open-sourcing</a>
    other needs can be met by the community.
