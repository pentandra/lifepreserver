  <h1>An <span class="excl">Open</span> Approach</h1>

  <p class="big">
    
    We live in a world that is full of interdependencies. Learning about our
    world and about ourselves doesn't need to be a solo activity. After all,
    we're all in this together, aren't we? Openness enables collaboration. Even
    the design of this web site implies an open, bold, and transparent
    approach.

    Here are a few ways to get involved:

    <p>

      The future of research is open. Open research involves collaboration
      throughout the research process, not just at the end when conclusions are
      written. Better conclusions can be reached quicker when researchers from
      different backgrounds and locations work together in a spirit of mutual
      cooperation.

    </p>
    <p>

      Transparency throughout the research process allows other
      researchers to assess the true nature and caliber of a research project
      and even build on top of it. So much more progress is possible when
      research is done this way.

  <h2>Open Source</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      Open-source software is software whose source code is freely available to
      the public, enabling the use, reuse, and improvement of that code. It
      also refers to a philosophy of collaborative development. We are
      supporters of open-source software. Our entire infrastructure is built
      upon it. We plan to contribute much of our source code to the community.
      We hope that others will benefit from this code and contribute back.

  <h2>Open Business</h2>

  <div class="bd">
    <p>

      We are in business to help make research easier. We figure if we are not
      doing that, we are doing something wrong. It is more likely that we will
      get it right if we learn from the principles of open research and open
      source and involve the community in our business development. Many in the
      community may have more experience or different perspectives than we do.
      It would be foolish to ignore this wealth of knowledge, ideas, and
      experience as we try to meet the needs of that community. Just like
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation_XVII" rel="external">no man is an island</a>,
      a business that isolates itself from its customers can't
      effectively give them what they need or want.

    </p>
    <p>

      We have a vision for <a href="/research/#future">the future of research</a>.
      We are more likely to attain that vision by opening the doors of
      knowledge, communication, and understanding between us and the community
      than by maintaining tight-lipped corporate secrecy.

      It's an experiment. We don't know how well it will work, but we think it
      will be great! No specific resume is required. ;) Please come and get
      involved!
