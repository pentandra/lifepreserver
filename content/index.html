    <h4>Clarity</h4>
    <p>
      Research is sometimes like a puzzle that can be put together in more than
      one way. Others need to know how you put the puzzle together, not just
      what the pieces are.

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>
      Research is more than conclusions. It starts with a question. That
      question leads to another. Eventually a clear picture emerges. But it's
      the journey that's important.

    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>
      We believe life is too short to redo other people's research. We can move
      faster and build better research conclusions as we work together. No man
      is an island.

     Research is a process of discovery. A discovery of questions, of clues, 
     and of ideas that grow together until answers are revealed. It is a
     cycle---a quest to understand self and the world around us. When you 
     discover something new about the world, it doesn't just add to the
     world's knowledgebase, it changes you. It is exhilarating and you
     can't wait to share it.
