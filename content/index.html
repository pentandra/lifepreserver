        Research is sometimes like a puzzle that can be put together in more
        than one way. Others need to know how you put the puzzle together, not
        just what the pieces are.

        Research is more than conclusions. It starts with a question. That
        question leads to another. Eventually a clear picture emerges. But it's
        the journey that's important.

        We believe life is too short to redo other people's research. We can

        Research is a process of discovery. A discovery of questions, of clues,
        and of ideas that grow together until answers are revealed. It is a
        cycle---a quest to understand self and the world around us. When you
        discover something new about the world, it doesn't just add to the
        world's knowledgebase, it changes you. It is exhilarating and you can't
        wait to share it.
