        Research is sometimes like a puzzle that can be put together in more
        than one way. Others need to know how you put the puzzle together, not
        just what the pieces are.

        Research is more than conclusions. It starts with a question. That

        the journey that's important.

      Research is a journey of discovery. It is a process with the ultimate
      goal of understanding ourselves and the world around us. We have some
      great ideas (at least we think they are) about the future of research and
      research collaboration. Let us share our vision with you.
