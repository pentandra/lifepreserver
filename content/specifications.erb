      We're working on technical specifications that enrich our abilities to
      share knowledge, opinion, and personal experience in our collective quest
      for greater light and understanding. Achieving <a
        href="/company/#sec:mission">our mission</a> calls for collaborating on
      these open technical standards.

  <h2>Machine Vocabularies</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      Specifications built using open machine vocabularies bring rich
      possibilities in our ability to communicate knowledge and understanding.
      These vocabularies are designed for web applications and open research
      systems and platforms. We use and refine them in the software we are
      creating. We hope they will prove useful to others as well.

      <p>

        We see the future of the Web made of clients that are more intelligent
        than the servers with which they interact. We need ways for these
        intelligent clients to uniformly interact, and we call these ways <dfn

        from traditional <i>application programming interfaces</i>. <abbr

      <h3 class="flush">Scholarly Commons</h3>

      <p>

        The Scholarly Commons is not a website, nor a platform or organization,
        but the convergence around a set of principles, standards, and best
        practices that govern how research artifacts (narrative, code, data,
        workflows, etc.) should be handled for maximum human and machine-based
        access. The Scholarly Commons is not an incremental improvement of the
        current system of scholarship and science, but a ground-up redesign of
        the entire system, from every perspective.
