      We're working on technical specifications that enrich our abilities to
      share knowledge, opinion, and personal experience in our collective quest
      for greater light and understanding. Achieving <a
        href="/company/#sec:mission">our mission</a> calls for collaborating on
      these open technical standards.

  <h2>Machine Vocabularies</h2>

  <div class="bd">

    <p>

      Specifications built using open machine vocabularies bring rich
      possibilities in our ability to communicate knowledge and understanding.
      These vocabularies are designed for web applications and open research
      systems and platforms. We use and refine them in the software we are
      creating. We hope they will prove useful to others as well.

        The Scholarly Commons is not a single platform or tool, but rather the

        the multidirectional flow of scholarly objects through all phases of
        the research process from conception to dissemination.
