Some really exciting news for the scholarly community was in my inbox this
morning. A new W3C community group has been created, the [Research Object for
Scholarly Communication](http://www.w3.org/community/rosc/) Community Group,
with a goal to discuss the future of scholarly communication.

Quoting from their charter:

> The primary goal...is to provide a platform for scholars, librarians,
> publishers, archivists and policy makers to exchange requirements and
> expectations for supporting a new form of scholarly communication, i.e.
> making the actual research assets available as first-class objects to enable
> better reuse and reproduce of research results and knowledge. These research
> assets, including data used and generated in an investigation, methods used
> for producing the data, as well as people and organisations involved in the
> study, are what we call **Research Objects**.

What they refer to as _research objects_, we call
[_research cases_](/research/process/#sec:research-case).

While this group has explicitly stated that they will not be publishing
specifications, it is exciting to see this kind of dialog starting to happen.
Having this evolve under the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) makes sense as well,
since research is cross-disciplinary and the actual dissemination of research
needs to take place over the web to be accessible to all. Isn't this [why the
Internet was created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpanet) to begin with?

We are really excited to be part of this change in the way research has been
disseminated for hundreds of years.

PS---We live in a world of acronym soup, and when we saw the acronym for ROSC
we had a good laugh. We have been working on a soon-to-be-open-source project
composed of the domain-agnostic guts of Geungle---essentially based on the
model of a case. We have named the project ROC. A funny coincidence of similar
naming! _(Watch for an announcement about ROC soon!)_
