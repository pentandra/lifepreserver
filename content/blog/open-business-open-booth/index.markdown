Wow! Has it actually been almost a full year since we headed off to take
Pentandra and Geungle to our first conference? Incredible! The conference in
Cincinnati last year for NGS (National Genealogical Society) inspired us and
uplifted us—both personally and as a company. Learning from incredibly
talented people and making some wonderful friends built us up. Plus, we got to
try our hand at stepping to the other side of the exhibit hall isle. We got to
take on the role of “vendors” for the very first time. (That was an interesting
experience in and of itself, but perhaps best left to another post another
day.)

## Open Business

We have decided to do something we wanted to do last year, but were perhaps a
bit too chicken to try the very first year in our new “vendor” role. Well, this
year, we are ready. We are opening our booth! To understand what that means, I
need to back up a bit. For those that have not made it that far through our
company website, we are an [Open Business](/open/business). To give a taste of
what that means to us, here is [a quote from our Open page](/open/#p[WaiJln],h[WaiJln,1,2,3,4,5]):

This open-ness is a two way street. We intend to be open about what we are
doing and why we choose to do it this way or that. We see no need to leave you
wondering what our ulterior motives are. I would rather just tell you. That way
you can know what our ACTUAL ulterior motives are, rather than some other bag
of imagined motivations. Plus, I would rather have you hear it from me than
from someone else. That is one way we work to be open.

As for the other side of that two way street, we genuinely want to get to know
the people in the community we are writing software for. (For Geungle, that is
easy to enjoy because we are genealogists at heart and in action. Heck, that's
what started this whole thing really.) We want to understand the coolest and
latest-greatest tricks and tips for doing great research. We want to learn from
others about what to do as well as what not to do. We want to get to know how
the community works, how they do what they do, and why it matters to them. Not
only that, but we genuinely care about advancing good research, both within
ourselves and for others as well. For that matter, our entire
[mission](/company#mission) is about improving research.

## Open Booth

We have the most comfy seats in the exhibit hall (blatantly biased opinion of
course), or at least the brightest red ones (unless someone else has decided
to follow our comfy and flashy example). There are only five of these sweet
chairs, which makes them absolutely perfect for a great small group discussion.
Each conference we have been to lately has had “un-conferencing” sessions to
open an opportunity to cover even more topics than can be covered by even the
richest of conference programs. I love that idea! Now we want to take that idea
and partner it with our desire to support good research.

That is where opening our booth comes in!

We are offering our booth as a place of learning and developing research skills
and understanding. We want to create an opportunity for people with great
thoughts about research to have a comfortable (think of those sweet chairs!),
welcoming, and more intimate place to create a discussion. In a way, this post
could be considered “a call for topics.” But these presentations will be more
like well-led roundtable discussions on a variety of research subjects.

I have seen hangouts, Q&A sessions, chats, webinars, and video conferences
happening online more and more. Think of this as an opportunity to switch to a
live and in person version of such a gathering. Many incredibly gifted people
will present lectures in the various sessions of the conference, but there are
many others who either do not want the pressure of a perfectly polished
presentation, that prefer leading discussions rather than presenting lectures,
or that have simply never had the opportunity to share in that kind of an
environment and need somewhere to start. There are also many acclaimed
lecturers, that present regularly, but who would love the opportunity to lead a
small and intimate discussion on a topic they are passionate about, but just
can't get a discussion up in a huge lecture hall like you can sitting in a
circle of friends and colleagues. If you relate to any of those situations, or
likely countless others that I didn't mention, then perhaps you are a perfect
fit to come and teach and train and lift and lead others in our Open Booth.

### What Kind of Discussions?


OK, so what if you fit the description of someone that could benefit from this
opportunity, but you are not sure the topic you would love to discuss would
really be a good fit? Let me try to break down the kinds of topics that would
be a good fit with two questions and their answers.

Question 1:
: Does what you want to present help increase or improve research in some way?

Answer 1:
: If the answer is yes, then it's likely a perfect fit!

Question 2:
: But what if my topic has nothing to do with Geungle or Pentandra?

Answer 2: 

: If we wanted all the talk in our booth to be about our company or about
Geungle, then why would we open our booth? I suppose I just answered a question
with a question, but we REALLY do want simply to invite discussions or
presentations into our booth that will edify this amazing research community!
We would LOVE to have our Open Booth be about more than US! Quality
genealogical research is much more important to us than Geungle is. Really.
Doing and learning how to do genealogy well might be assisted by having a
really good program (at least we hope so—that's why we started Geungle). But
we are keenly aware that we still have lots of room to learn a whole lot more
from other genealogists and so do most people doing genealogy. I'm talking
about training that no computer can replace. On top of that, Pentandra is all
about research. Software is our tool to allow us to try to help improve
research. But the research is the point, not us and our ideas.

So, if you have an idea to share that will also help improve research, please
come and share it with others! Now I will fill you in on one of my ulterior
motives...When you present in our booth, then Chris or I get the outstanding
opportunity to eavesdrop on what you are teaching your small group and we just
might be lucky enough to learn something wonderful as well! I can't wait!

### How will it Work?

Alright, let me attempt to break this down into some straightforward
particulars.

1. You let us know that you would like to present or lead a discussion on
   ____________________ (your topic of choice) and any timing considerations
   that you might have. (Obviously it would be silly to set you up with a time
   to lead a discussion in the Open Booth while you are in the middle of giving
   a lecture in another part of the conference center or while you are staffing
   your local society's booth on the other side of the exhibit hall.)

2. We set up a time for you on our schedule of Open Booth Chats. (Ooo, I just
   made up that name for what to call these, I think I like it!)

3. We get the word out about your topic and the time of your Open Booth Chat in
   one of three ways. You just let me know which one you prefer and we go with
   that.

   1. You tell those people you specifically want to have join in your
      discussion about your topic and time and invite them to come. Your Open
      Booth Chat will be listed on our website, but we will not actively
      advertise it. Essentially, we just stay out of the way, so that you have
      the people that YOU want there.

   2. We list your Chat on our site, and then we go let all of our genealogy
      friends know about it, with a broad and open invitation to anyone that
      wants to come. This may lead to interesting numbers in either direction.
      If you have a tiny group, then Chris and I will actually pull up a chair
      ourselves and join in too! (You might not think that deserves an
      exclamation point mark, but trust me, I would be excited to join in like
      that.) The opposite issue could also arise. If your group outgrows our
      five chairs, we will have a couple of folding chairs for back-up. And
      then there is always the option for standing room right?

   3. You invite who you would like and we throw out a broad invitation as
      well. You know, we sort of combine efforts.

4. At the conference, you come to our booth a couple minutes before your
   scheduled time so we can say hi and meet you face to face in case we have
   only met online before (another great perk for us).

5. The other participants will come and take a seat in one of our sweet chairs. 

6. You can use our white board or simply sit in the group and present your
   thoughts. If you have never presented before and would like to record it to
   submit with a future lecture proposal, you are welcome to have someone come
   along to record it.

7. When you are finished, everyone goes on their way, hopefully with some new
   ideas, tools, skills, or insights!

8. Oh, and we provide the treats for while you are presenting. (I am fairly
   convinced that there are few things to talk about that don't get better with
   a bowl of candy to enhance the experience. Right?)

That's it. Simple.

Like so many things we do, or have done, or hope to do in the future, this is
an experiment. We have no idea how well it will be received, but for the sake
of offering one more chance to learn from each other, we are willing to give it
a try. So, if you have a great idea you would like to share or discuss, please
let us know. 

If you would like to find out what topics will be covered in our Open Booth,
then please check out our Conferences page through the week of NGS in Las
Vegas. If you have any other ideas that you think we should be thinking about,
please drop us a note or drop by our booth to chat. Really—please do.
