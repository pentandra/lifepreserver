![NGS 2012 Conference](/images/2012_NGS_Logo_Final.jpg){: .mod .aside .static }

Pentandra is heading to the [National Genealogical Society
conference](http://www.ngsgenealogy.org/cs/conference_info) this year! I can't
believe that the long-awaited day is approaching so fast. We are so excited.
This will be the first conference of any kind that we will have attended as a
company. While have attended the last two years as NGS members brainstorming
our business idea, this year we are looking forward to sharing with everyone
what we have been working on and what we're trying to do.

## Booth Approaches
{: .bigger }

For the last couple weeks, we have been working on our booth. While designing
the booth, a big question was, "What do we want people to experience when they
see and visit our booth?" People set up booths at trade shows to sell software,
books, hotel stays, computers or mobile devices, etc. Why are _we_ setting up a
booth?

The answer that kept impressing on us was that we need to have a booth that
invites people in for open discussion. There are many booths that feel closed
off, giving the feeling that the company likes a separation between itself and
its customers. We feel that our customers are part of our company and we want
them to feel welcome to come in and make themselves at home. We're just
ordinary people trying to do amazing things. We want others to be a part of it.

We are a software company, but we feel that is only *part* of what we are
trying to offer. Community is very important to us. Part of the reason we are
[open](/open/) is so that we can become an active, contributing member of the
genealogy community---we don't want to be labeled merely as a "vendor." We're
starting small, but we hope that a community of developers, genealogists,
marketers, and enthusiasts will _want_ to join us in an awesome project with
ambitious goals.

So we had the idea to use chairs set up in the form of a pentagon in the center
of the booth. We found some really fun bright-red corner chairs that look a bit
like the arrow tips of our logo. People can come and talk in comfort. We will
have a bookcase of interesting books about research and other topics that you
can peruse at your pleasure. We want our booth to be a place where people can
come for inspiration, rejuvenation, or to just take a break from their research
labors.

We hope that people will want to get involved, and that this won't be a
complete flop. Our success depends on people like you. We can't do what we hope
to accomplish without your help.

We're Open. Come on in and get involved!
