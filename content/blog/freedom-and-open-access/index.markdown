I have been thinking a lot about open access lately and how it relates to what
we are trying to accomplish at Pentandra. I'm not going to go into the details
of open access here, you can read about that
[elsewhere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), but I do want to discuss
what it means to us and how that influences our approach to software design.

In principle, we support the idea of open access. It just makes sense for the
public to have open access to the research it paid for. Researchers like open
access because it enables their research to have a broader dissemination and a
subsequently larger impact. Pretty much, the only people that don't like it are
the journal publishers.[^anti-OA] It kind of messes up their business model,
which has been working great for them for the last <span
class="oldstyle">100+</span> years.

<!--MORE-->

In general, academic research is being published the same way it has been
published since the beginning of academic publishing (or at least since
[Johannes Gutenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) was
around). In recent years, the venerable research paper has evolved from a
simple paper publication to a complex digital publication as a PDF. This rather
small change has made research papers much cheaper to distribute, making ideas
like open access financially feasible. So when people talk about open access,
they are talking about offering the results (research papers and sometimes the
underlying data as well) of publicly-funded research to the public at no extra
charge over the Internet. 

The problem is that publishers don't want these research papers distributed
freely. They want them behind a paywall so they can continue to profit from
their business model, which is based primarily on journal subscriptions. 

As a researcher, I don't want to shell out <span class="oldstyle">$8--30</span>
per paper when I don't even know beforehand whether the paper will
significantly help my research project. If I was not a student of an academic
institution where I have access to some of the more popular journals, I
probably would not risk the expense unless the paper's abstract was
particularly convincing.

When research is disseminated openly, the entry barrier to build upon that
research is lowered significantly. Anyone can access the research, with or
without an academic affiliation. Further research and innovation can then
accelerate more quickly with less expense.

## Public Policy

Right now, the discussion about open access is centered around publicly-funded
research. These public funds are distributed by the government to researchers
in the form of grants, and because the government is distributing the money, it
sets the rules. Ideally, those rules would be in the public interest. To give
some context to our thoughts, let me summarize what is being done about open
access right now by governments around the world.

The European Union and the UK specifically seem to be the most progressive in
the promotion of open access. The EU has started an initiative called
[Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/index_en.cfm?pg=home&video=none)
which mandates open access dissemination of publicly-funded research by
<span class="oldstyle">2016</span>. The UK has mandated that all
publicly-funded research will be offered openly by
<span class="oldstyle">2014</span>.

In the US the situation is a little different. Several attempts have been made
to legislate open access. In <span class="oldstyle">2008</span>, a bill was
successfully passed that required that all NIH-funded research be submitted to
[PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/), an open access repository
for the biomedical and life sciences. Following up with that win, the
[Federal Research Public Access Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act),
which would mandate similar requirements across all the big governmental
funding agencies, has been introduced to US Congress three times up to this
point in time, but has not made it out of committee, primarily because of the 
lobbying of the Association of American Publishers.[^AAP]

More recently, attempts have been made to promote *closed* access to
publicly-funded research.  The most caddish proposal was made right before the
holidays at the end of last year: the [Research Works Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act).[^RWA]
This act would prohibit any federal agency from mandating open access without
the consent of the publishers, in effect, giving publishers complete control to
restrict public access to all publicly-funded research. Oh, and not letting the
government have a say in it. This is complete troll-like behavior. The public
has paid for this bridge and the publishers want to make a profit off of anyone
who crosses, and they act as if they are entitled to do it. 

C'mon, publishers, are you so comfortable with your presses that you require
legislation to perpetuate your antiquated business model? There are
[so many other options](http://gigaom.com/2012/03/26/dont-build-a-paywall-create-a-velvet-rope-instead/)
for monetizing the research and publication industry! Come down from your
this-is-how-it-has-always-been-done ivory towers and get with the program.

Recently, the governor of Georgia announced that the Georgia State Archives
would be closed to the public due to budget cuts. They couldn't afford to pay
the staff. Over the last <span class="oldstyle">10</span> years, Georgia has 
cut staff at the archives from <span class="oldstyle">53</span> employees down
to three.[^GSA]

What has the Georgia State Archives to do with open access? Everything. While a
lot of discussion on open access centers around research papers, a big part of
the equation is the [research data](/research/process/#p[DirGaf],h[DirGaf,1,2,DciDce,1]).
Without the data, there would be no papers! If the data is locked up in an
inaccessible archive, it sure makes it hard to access! Why does access to the
data matter? Because without the access, we can't use it. And all the research
that has used that data cannot be verified anymore.

Closing the archives also sets a dangerous precedent for thoughtless
legislators to follow when looking for quick and easy budget cuts. Some say
that we are entering the
[beginning of the Dark Ages](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/us/budget-cuts-to-limit-public-access-to-georgia-archives.html?_r=0#p[WohFyo],h[WohFyo,1])
for public records. (If you have not done so already, please
[sign the petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/the-governor-of-ga-leave-our-state-archives-open-to-the-public)
to save the Georgia State Archives!)

## A Closer Look

Open access is a complicated and highly-debated topic right now. Many people
sit on both sides of the fence. A researcher may publish, referee, and even sit
on editorial boards, all at the same time! If you have a spare half-hour, this
is a good round-table discussion on open access that gives a deeper look into
some of the issues. If you don't have much time right now, feel free to pick a

## Our Approach

So what does open access mean for us? How does it affect our software design
approach? This could be summed up in two points:

1. We believe that for many fields, the research paper is not a good fit for
   the dissemination of research. Research is an iterative process and an
   iterative model for research publication is a much better solution to the
   problem. This allows research conclusions to be disseminated little by
   little, instead of in one monolithic publication.

2. While wikis are being used successfully for collaborative, iterative
   research dissemination in fields such as math, for many fields this is not
   enough. A [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) deals primarily with
   textual revisions and does not provide the structure to follow a research
   conclusion back to the underlying sources.  Research semantics get lost, and
   [citations are just not enough](/research/#p[RsbOsr],h[RsbOsr,3]). We
   believe we have a solution to that problem.
   
### An Iterative Model

Over the last decade software development processes have evolved from a
[waterfall model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) to more
[iterative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development)
methodologies. People realized that it just didn't work to go through one giant
iteration when designing a complicated software system. It is much more
efficient to go through many small iterations through the development process.

Research is, by nature, iterative. It is very uncommon to come to a correct
conclusion to any sophisticated research question in one fell swoop. Yet the
research paper model promotes the idea that the research needs to be completely
finished before it can be published. For some research questions, that is a
good way to go, but for most, it is better to get the research out there to
enable collaboration in earlier phases of the research process. Things just get
done faster this way. As research progresses, the output is presented in an
incremental, natural way.

With research, the pre-publication peer review makes more sense in a
print paradigm, where a paper is printed once and can't be changed after
publication. While we are familiar with this paradigm, and much of academia
uses it, paper publications are just not a very good fit for the research
process. It was just all that was available at the time.

If you are not convinced, take a look at the open-source software movement. I
know that software is not research, but the underlying processes are very
similar. A software developer's research output is, if you will, the source
code. Using some sort of iterative methodology, the developer will build little
pieces of functionality. The researcher "develops" conclusions in a similar
manner. I will have more to say about this in a later article.

### Beyond Wikis

Research is messy. Sometimes it just doesn't fit very well in a four page
research paper. There are some excellent examples of the use of wikis in
research dissemination, such as [Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/),
wikis are still based on the research paper model. Collaboration occurs only
during the writing of the paper, and not during the whole research process. 

Our approach is to build software around the
[unit of research](/research/process/#unit). This gives research a natural
structure that can be shared or developed in an understandable and
collaborative way. This is an important distinction between true
[research software](/research/#p[WtrHwt],h[WtrHwt,2,3]) and wikis. While it is
possible to provide open access to a research paper and even to the underlying
research data by placing it on the web, if we fail to show _how_ they are
connected, then we are failing to give people access to the research and
thought processes behind those research outputs. We need the whole research
[context](/research#context) to really understand those research outputs.

## Why Genealogy?

So where does genealogy fit in all this?

In many research fields, researchers advance their careers through journal
publication. Many of these journals are "held hostage" by some of the big
publishers, including Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer. However, genealogists do
not suffer with this blight. There are a few high-quality journals published in
the field, including the [National Genealogical Society Quarterly](http://www.ngsgenealogy.org/cs/ngsq)
and [The Genealogist](http://www.fasg.org/TheGenealogist.html). These journals
are published by genealogical societies or through universities, and the
peer-review process handled by the society. While the journals are highly
regarded, journal publications are not the primary path for career advancement
in genealogy. Most career advancement is done through private client research
and word-of-mouth.

Genealogy has traditionally been looked on as history's red-headed stepchild.
This is due in part to the large number of amateur researchers, and in part to
misunderstandings as to what good genealogical research looks like. But it has
become a very rigorous, multifaceted research field, the output of which other
fields grow increasingly dependent on.

We are starting with genealogy, first of all, because genealogists are looking
for more efficient and robust ways to collaborate and disseminate their
research. Their are fewer barriers for us to overcome because we don't have to
compete with a deeply entrenched, highly expensive journal as the primary means
for career advancement. We also view genealogy as a highly engaging research
field. I mean who doesn't care about the past and how their ancestors were
affected by it or how their ancestors affected the past? Our approach is not so
much about family trees (there are plenty of companies that do that), but it
could be called micro-history or generational history research (for more info
about that see [Geungle](/products#geungle)).

## Freedom

In that past (as in before the Internet), these high-profile, prestigious
journals were the best way to get access to the latest research. Nowadays there
are faster and better ways to communicate and disseminate scholarly research,
and the big journal publishers are actually getting in the way and slowing down
research dissemination. When it comes down to it, this is all about freedom.
There is just no good reason anymore why a third party should stand at the gate
of publicly-funded research, giving or denying access to whomsoever it wishes.
Any time there is someone arbitrarily regulating the free flow of information
(or research, in this case), we as, researchers, entrepreneurs, and citizens
will not have access to the information we need to make the best decisions in
our jobs, lives, and nations.

We, at Pentandra, are committed to designing research software from the ground
up with open access in mind. While there are some exciting advancements in
current research software, such as [Utopia Documents](http://utopiadocs.com/),
we think that these improvements are transitional, and that the future of
research lies in open, [domain-specific](/research/#p[WtrHwt],h[WtrHwt,2])
research systems.

As always, I would love to hear your thoughts.

## Footnotes

[^anti-OA]: Some publishers do support open access. The most commonly supported is
    Gold Open Access, where the author pays the fee to publish his research,
    and then the public does not need to pay anything for access. Gold Open
    Access has an obvious scalable business model and publishers are still able
    to maintain some control over access, such as embargoes.
