I have been thinking a lot about Open Access lately and how it relates to what
we are trying to accomplish at Pentandra. I'm not going to go into the details
of OA here, you can read about that
[elsewhere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), but I do want to discuss
what it means to us and how that influences our approach to software design.

In principle, we support the idea of OA. It just makes sense for the public to
have open access to the research it paid for. Researchers like OA because it
enables their research to have a broader dissemination and a subsequently
larger impact. Pretty much, the only people that don't like it are the journal
publishers.[^anti-OA] It kind of messes up their business model, which has been
working great for them for the last <span class="oldstyle">100+</span> years.

<!--MORE-->

In general, academic research is being published the same way it has been
published since the beginning of academic publishing (or at least since
[Johannes Gutenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) was
around). In recent years, the venerable research paper has gone from being
published on paper to being published as a PDF as well. This rather simple
change has made research papers much cheaper to distribute, making ideas like
OA financially feasible. So when people talk about OA, they are talking about
offering the results (research papers and sometimes the underlying data as
well) of publicly-funded research to the public at no extra charge
over the Internet. 

The problem is that publishers don't want these research papers distributed
freely. They want them behind a paywall so they can continue to profit from
their business model, which is based primarily on journal subscriptions. 

As a researcher, I don't want to shell out <span class="oldstyle">$8--30</span>
per paper when I don't even know beforehand whether the paper will
significantly help my research project. If I was not a student of an academic
institution where I have access to some of the more popular journals, I
probably would not risk the expense unless the paper's abstract was
particularly convincing.

When research is disseminated openly, the entry barrier to build upon that
research is lowered significantly. Anyone can access the research, with or
without an academic affiliation. Further research and innovation can then
accelerate more quickly and with less expense.

## Public Policy

To give some context to our thoughts about OA, let me summarize what is being
done about OA right now in governments around the world.

The [European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) seems to be
the most progressive in the promotion of OA. They have started an initiative
called [Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/index_en.cfm?pg=home&video=none)
in which Open Access plays a big part. The UK has mandated that all
publicly-funded research be offered Open Access by
<span class="oldstyle">2014</span>.

In the US the situation is a little different. Several attempts have been made
to legislate OA, including the [Federal Research Public Access Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act).
The lobbying of the Association of American Publishers was primarily responsible
for the fact that FRPAA did not become law.[^FRPAA] More recently, attempts have
been made to promote *closed* access to publicly-funded research. The most
caddish proposal was made right before the holidays at the end of last year: the [Research Works Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act).[^RWA]
This act would prohibit any federal agency from mandating OA without the
consent of the publishers, in effect, giving publishers complete control to
restrict public access to all publicly-funded research. Oh, and also telling
the government to get out. This is complete troll-like behavior. The public has
paid for this bridge and the publishers want to make a profit off of anyone who
crosses.

C'mon, publishers, are you so comfortable with your presses that you require
legislation to enforce your business model? There are
[so many other options](http://gigaom.com/2012/03/26/dont-build-a-paywall-create-a-velvet-rope-instead/)
for monetizing the research and publication industry! Come down from your
this-is-how-it-has-always-been-done ivory towers and get with the program.

Recently, the governor of Georgia announced that the Georgia State Archives
would be closed to the public due to budget cuts. Georgia has also cut staff
at the archives from <span class="oldstyle">53</span> employees down to 
<span class="oldstyle">3</span> over the last <span class="oldstyle">10</span>
years.[^GSA] Some say that this is the
[beginning of the Dark Ages](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/us/budget-cuts-to-limit-public-access-to-georgia-archives.html?_r=0#p[WohFyo],h[WohFyo,1])
for public records. (If you have not done so already, please
[sign the petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/the-governor-of-ga-leave-our-state-archives-open-to-the-public)
to save the Georgia State Archives!)

What has the Georgia State Archives to do with Open Access? Everything. While a
lot of discussion on OA centers around research papers, a big part of the
equation is the [research data](/research/process/#p[DirGaf],h[DirGaf,1,2,DciDce,1]).
If the data is locked up in an inaccessible archive, it sure makes it hard to
access!

Why does it matter? It's that without the access, we can't use it.

It also sets a dangerous precedent for thoughtless legislators to
follow when looking for quick and easy budget cuts. (What can we do to lower
fiscal expenses and promote OA?)

However, not everything in the US is this bleak. A bill was passed in
<span class="oldstyle">2008</span> that required that all NIH-funded research be
submitted to [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) to be made
publicly available no later than <span class="oldstyle">12</span> months after
the publication date. This is the main reason that many of the research papers
in the biomedical and life sciences are publicly available in the US.

## Our Approach

So what does OA mean for us? How does it affect our software design approach?
This could be summed up in two points:

1. We believe that for many fields, the research paper is not a good fit for
   the dissemination of research. Research is an iterative process and an
   iterative model for research publication is a much better solution to the
   problem. This allows research conclusions to be disseminated little by
   little, instead of in one monolithic publication.

2. While wikis are being used successfully for collaborative, iterative
   research dissemination in fields such as math, for many fields this is not
   enough. A [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) deals primarily with
   textual revisions and does not provide the structure to follow a research
   conclusion back to the underlying sources.  Research semantics get lost, and
   [citations are just not enough](/research/#p[RsbOsr],h[RsbOsr,3]). We
   believe we have a solution to that problem.
   
### An Iterative Model

Over the last decade software development processes have evolved from a
[waterfall model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) to more
[iterative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development)
methodologies. People realized that it just didn't work to go through one giant
iteration when designing a complicated software system. It is much more
efficient to go through many small iterations through the development process.

Research is, by nature, iterative. It is very uncommon to come to a correct
conclusion to any sophisticated research question in one fell swoop. Yet the
research paper model promotes the idea that the research needs to be completely
finished before it can be published. For some research questions, that is a
good way to go, but for most, it is better to get the research out there to
enable collaboration in earlier phases of the research process. Things just get
done faster this way. As research progresses, the output is presented in an
incremental, natural way.

With research, the pre-publication peer review makes more sense in a
print paradigm, where a paper is printed once and can't be changed after
publication. While we are familiar with this paradigm, and much of academia
uses it, paper publications are just not a very good fit for the research
process. It was just all that was available at the time.

If you are not convinced, take a look at the open-source software movement. I
know that software is not research, but the underlying processes are very
similar. A software developer's research output is, if you will, the source
code. Using some sort of iterative methodology, the developer will build
little pieces of functionality. The researcher "develops" conclusions in a
similar manner. I will have more to say about this in a later article.

### Beyond Wikis

Research is messy. Sometimes it just doesn't fit very well in a four page
research paper. There are some excellent examples of the use of wikis in
research dissemination, such as [Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/),
wikis are still based on the research paper model. Collaboration occurs as the
paper is written, and not during the whole research process. 

Our approach is to build software around the
[unit of research](/research/process/#unit). This gives research a natural
structure that can be shared or developed in an understandable and
collaborative way. This is an important distinction between true
[research software](/research/#p[WtrHwt],h[WtrHwt,2,3]) and wikis. While it is
possible to provide open access to a research paper and even to the underlying 
research data by placing it on the web, if we fail to show _how_ they are
connected, then we are failing with OA.

## Why Genealogy?

So where does genealogy fit in all this?

In many research fields, researchers advance their careers through journal
publication. Many of these journals are "held hostage" by some of the big
publishers, including Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer. However, genealogists do
not suffer with this blight. There are a few high-quality journals published in
the field, including the [National Genealogical Society Quarterly](http://www.ngsgenealogy.org/cs/ngsq)
and [The Genealogist](http://www.fasg.org/TheGenealogist.html). These journals
are published by genealogical societies or through universities, and the
peer-review process handled by the society. While the journals are highly
regarded, journal publications are not the primary path for career advancement
in this field. Most career advancement is done through private client research
and word-of-mouth.

Genealogy has traditionally been looked on as history's red-headed stepchild.
This is due in part to the large number of amateur researchers, and part to
misunderstandings as to what good genealogical research looks like. But it has
become a very rigorous, multifaceted research field, the output of which other
fields grow increasingly dependent on.

We are starting with genealogy, first of all, because genealogists are looking
for more efficient and robust ways to collaborate and disseminate their
research. Their are fewer barriers for us to overcome because we don't have to
compete with a deeply entrenched, highly expensive journal as the primary means
for career advancement. We also view genealogy as a highly engaging research
field. I mean who doesn't care about the past and how their ancestors were
affected by it or how their ancestors affected the past? Our approach is not so
much about family trees (there are plenty of companies that do that), but it
could be called micro-history or generational history research (for more info
about that see [Geungle](/products#geungle)).

## Freedom

In reality this is all about freedom. In that past (as in before the Internet),
these high-profile, prestigious journals were the best way to get access to the
latest research. Nowadays there are faster and better ways to communicate and
disseminate scholarly research, and the big journal publishers are actually
getting in the way and slowing down the dissemination of research. There is no
reason why a third party should stand at the gate of publicly-funded research,
giving or denying access to whomsoever it wishes.  Any time there is someone
arbitrarily regulating the free flow of information (or research, in this
case), we as, researchers, entrepreneurs, and citizens will not have access to
the information we need to make the best decisions in our jobs, lives, and
nations.

We, at Pentandra, are committed to designing research software from the ground
up with Open Access in mind.

As always, I would love to hear your thoughts. What do you think of our
approach to Open Access?

## Footnotes

[^anti-OA]: Some publishers do support Open Access. The most commonly supported is
    Gold Open Access, where the author pays the fee to publish his research,
    and then the public does not need to pay anything for access. Gold Open
    Access has an obvious scalable business model and publishers are still able
    to maintain some control over access, such as embargoes.
    [More information about methods of financing Open Access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Methods_of_financing_gold_open_access_publishing)

    of the Research Works Act.

[^GSA]: Starting November <span class="oldstyle">1</span> of this year,
    [Georgia State Archives will lose seven](http://georgiaarchivesmatters.org/2012/09/27/the-staff-what-we-stand-to-lose/)
    of the remaining ten employees. At the same time, Georgia is spending

    [build a new football stadium](http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/print-edition/2012/05/11/atlantas-proposed-new-football.html?page=all)
    instead of retrofitting the Georgia Dome with a retractable roof.

[^RWA]: The [Research Works Act](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03699:@@@L&summ2=m&)
