A couple months ago I was speaking with a friend at a conference in San
Francisco, and mentioned that I was working on software for genealogical
research. He said, "Cool! Genealogy has a lot of structured, tree-like data.
It must be fun to integrate with all that data." Without realizing it, my
friend described what most people think about when they describe technology for
genealogy. Sticking peoples' names and dates on a tree. Sounds fun, right? It's
actually kind of addictive until you realize that with each generation the tree
gets bigger by a power of two, and in most family history software right now,
the tree never ends, it turns into a math problem and just keeps on going
forever...but that's a different story.

## Is Genealogy Tree-like Data?

Looking at genealogy in this way is both a shallow and distorted view of
reality. Was the sole purpose of Doe Darling's existence to produce seven
nicely named children, all lined up neatly in a row? I hope not.

Looking at genealogy as a bunch of interconnected family trees is akin to
looking at the World Wide Web as a bunch of nodes and edges. While the view may
nice to look at, it's not all there is to it. You may have [browsed to this
node at will](http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html), but you probably didn't think
of it that way.

## Our Perspective

We (at Pentandra) look at genealogy as the study of _lives_---of mankind.
Life is messy. Life is full. Life is complicated. Life is rich. A pedigree
chart would be the last thing I would pick to describe it.

In the essay, [The Servant as Leader](https://greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/),
Robert Greenleaf quotes Percy Bridgeman, the physicist and philosopher,

> "No linguistic structure is capable of reproducing the full complexity of
> experience... The only feasible way of dealing with this is to push a
> particular verbal line of attack as far as it can go, and then switch to
> another verbal level which we might abandon when we have to... Many
> people...insist on a single self-consistent verbal scheme into which they try
> to force all experience. In doing this they create a purely verbal world in
> which they can live a pretty autonomous existence, fortified by the ability
> of many of their fellows to live in the same verbal world."

While Bridgeman is talking about linguistic structures here, not software, I
think it still applies. All of the technological approaches that I've seen up
to this point (please let me know if I'm missing something out there), cram
people's lives into a "single, self-consistent verbal scheme" (however pretty
it may be) that totally ruins the whole experience for me. I start focusing on
the wrong things, and look at the people as dry, lifeless data. Genealogy is in
danger because of technologies like these that oversimplify the research
process. This software-for-the-masses approach has watered down genealogy into
a quest to fill in slots on a pedigree chart.[^motivations] There must be a better way.

## Why Genealogy?

So where does genealogy fit in all this?

To do genealogy right, we need to reconstruct the world of those past. As such,
we see genealogy, or as we would call it, [generational history][gen_hist], as
the ultimate meta-domain---it's the study of the entirety of mankind,
individually and collectively.

Vapor is the only thing holding up many of these conclusions.

In many research fields, researchers advance their careers through journal
publication. Many of these journals are "held hostage" by some of the big
publishers, including Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer. However, genealogists do
not suffer with this blight. There are a few high-quality journals published in
the field, including the [National Genealogical Society
Quarterly][NGSQ]{:.external} and [The Genealogist][TG]{:.external}. These
journals are published by genealogical societies or through universities, and
the peer-review process handled by the society. While the journals are highly
regarded, journal publications are not the primary path for career advancement
in genealogy. Most career advancement is done through private client research
and word-of-mouth.

Genealogy has traditionally been looked on as history's red-headed stepchild.
This is due in part to the large number of amateur researchers, and in part to
misunderstandings as to what good genealogical research looks like. But it has
become a very rigorous, multifaceted research field, the output of which other
fields grow increasingly dependent on.

We are starting with genealogy, first of all, because genealogists are looking
for more efficient and robust ways to collaborate and disseminate their
research. Their are fewer barriers for us to overcome because we don't have to
compete with a deeply entrenched, highly expensive journal as the primary means
for career advancement. We also view genealogy as a highly engaging research
field. I mean who doesn't care about the past and how their ancestors were
affected by it or how their ancestors affected the past? Our approach is not so
much about family trees (there are plenty of companies that do that), but it
could be called micro-history or generational history research (for more info
about that see [Geungle](/solutions/#geungle)).

## What's needed?

Like most things in life, a combination of things must happen to make
genealogical research a more meaningful and productive experience.

First, we need more people to realize there is a problem. For many,
genealogical research is their first foray into the world of research, and
many, even long-time genealogists, do not know what good genealogical research
looks like. It doesn't take long for the current software to convince newcomers
that genealogy is nothing more than a collection of names and dates, with a few
images thrown in for good measure.[^caveat]

Second, as wonderful as the [Genealogical Proof
Standard](http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html) is, we need
software that shows, as transparently as possible, what good research looks
like. People learn best with examples and feedback (and maybe with a teensy bit
of social pressure thrown in). We're working on this with Geungle and other
initiatives, but right now it is a lot of pioneering work.

While those two would be a good start, here are a few other things to keep in
mind:

* We need to accept the fact that this is research. Just because it is
  research, does not mean it is above our heads, or than we're not smart enough
  to participate. This is the study of life---of mankind---a domain in which all
  of us should have at least _some_ experience. But it _is_ research, and we
  need to treat it as such. We need to be reasoning things out and creating
  solid inferences that we wouldn't be afraid to stick our names on.
* Relationships between evidence and claims must be treated as first-class
  citizens by technology. It's the only real thing that we've got to go on most
  of the time, except for analyses (created by researchers) using that
  evidence. The chains of evidence that tie all the research together must be
  transparent (and exist).
* Just because it is in print (or pixel) does not mean it's true. The inverse
  also applies: just because you can enter it easily into a computer does not
  mean it becomes true.
* Reconstructing lives includes reconstructing the world in which these people,
  whom we're studying, lived. There must be room for experimentation,
  hypotheses, and alternate or hypothetical realities.
* Only _after_ you have all the pieces can you be really sure about what the
  puzzle is actually representing.
* If you follow the preceding point's logic further, that means that tools for
  genealogy must be founded on something other than identity, since identity
  must be proven first, by evidence.
* Questions must be studied in context. We cannot rip someone out of their
  world and expect to get a good understanding of who they were by studying
  their vital information alone. People are part of the world context in which
  they lived. They cannot be taken out of that world, they are part of it, and
  must be studied in that context.
* Answers must be articulated in a way that promotes understanding, deeper
  insight, and further research. Presenting good research is all about
  communication. It's an art. While a computer can help make this process
  easier, humans are still needed.

After all of that, could we not still show relationships using a pedigree
chart? Yes! But we _cannot_ begin and end there. We need to do (and publish)
more.

[^life]: 
    We've tried telling people that were writing software for [generational
    history](/blog/thoughts-about-rootstech-2012#what-is-a-user) or
    [microhistory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microhistory), but we've gotten
    a lot of blank looks, even from historians! When we say we're writing
    software for genealogy, people are _way_ more understanding.

[^caveat]: 
    It is important to note that there are many knowledgeable genealogists that
    come to the table with some sort of conceptual research framework that they
    use to guide their research. Some may use these tools, despite the inherent
    limitations, for part of their research output, but they are generally not
    used during the research process.

[^analysis-trees]:
    Actually this is not entirely true. Trees and graphs are used in
    genealogical research, not as a publication format, but as a tool for
    analysis. They are great for trying to make sense out of the relationships
    in a family or community while working on a research question.

[^ee]:
    Elizabeth Shown Mills has more to say about this topic on her blog,
    [_QuickLesson 18: Genealogy? In the Academic World? Seriously?_](https://www.evidenceexplained.com/content/quicklesson-18-genealogy-academic-world-seriously) (2014),
    and in her papers, [_Bridging the Historic Divide: Family History and 'Academic'    History_](http://www.historicpathways.com/download/bridghisdivideivide.pdf) (2007)
    and [_Genealogy in the Information Age: History's New Frontier?_](http://www.historicpathways.com/download/genininfoage.pdf) (2003).

[^motivations]:

    A lot of pressure is on software developers to produce software like this.
    Since it does not require much training or know-how to enter names into a
    record manager, such software potentially has a much bigger market. This
    type of thinking is short-sighted, however, and has perpetuated many of the
    problems that we see in the genealogy community today.
