OK. We've had people ask us why we are worrying about the bigger research
community. Shouldn't we be focusing on genealogy?

Good question.

Let me share with you some of our thoughts on the subject. Keep in mind that I
am an avid proponent of all those that build technologies for genealogy. I just
think that technology for genealogy is stuck right now. Don't get me wrong,
there are wonderful products coming out of these companies. The record
digitization and indexing are, in particular, amazing achievements that will
benefit researchers for many years to come. What I have beef with involves the
prolific, unsubstantiated family trees that seem to grow on everyone's wall.
Well, technologically speaking, I think the ladder is on the wrong wall, and
engineers at FamilySearch, Ancestry.com, and other wonderful companies have
taken this paradigm as far as it can go, but it is not solving the problems
that so desperately need to be solved. I think it's time for a fresh look at
the thing we call genealogy.

## Genealogy?

A couple months ago I was speaking with a friend at a conference in San
Francisco, and mentioned that I was working on software for genealogical
research. He said, "Cool! Genealogy has a lot of structured, tree-like data.
It must be fun to integrate with all that data." Without realizing it, my
friend described what most people think about when they describe technology for
genealogy. Sticking peoples' names and dates on a tree. Sounds fun, right? It's
actually kind of addictive until you realize that with each generation the tree
gets bigger by a power of two, and in most family history software right now,
the tree never ends, it turns into a math problem and just keeps on going
forever... but that's a different story.

Looking at genealogy in this way is both a shallow and distorted view of
reality. Was the sole purpose of Doe Darling's existence to produce seven
nicely named children, all lined up neatly in a row? I hope not.

We (at Pentandra) look at genealogy as the study of _lives_; of mankind.[^life]
Life is messy. Life is full. Life is complicated. Life is rich. A pedigree
chart would be the last thing I would pick to describe it.

In the essay, [The Servant as Leader](https://greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/),
Robert Greenleaf quotes Percy Bridgeman, the physicist and philosopher,

> "No linguistic structure is capable of reproducing the full complexity of
> experience... The only feasible way of dealing with this is to push a
> particular verbal line of attack as far as it can go, and then switch to
> another verbal level which we might abandon when we have to... Many
> people...insist on a single self-consistent verbal scheme into which they try
> to force all experience. In doing this they create a purely verbal world in
> which they can live a pretty autonomous existence, fortified by the ability
> of many of their fellows to live in the same verbal world."

While Bridgeman is talking about linguistic structures here, not software, I
think it still applies. All of the technological approaches that I've seen up
to this point (please let me know if I'm missing something out there), cram
people's lives into a "single, self-consistent verbal scheme" (however pretty
it may be) that totally ruins the whole experience for me. I start focusing on
the wrong things, and look at the people as dry, lifeless data. There must be a
better way.

## What's needed?

Like most things in life, a combination of things must happen to make
genealogical research a more meaningful and productive experience.

First, we need more people to realize there is a problem. For many,
genealogical research is their first foray into the world of research, and
many, even long-time genealogists, do not know what good genealogical research
looks like. It doesn't take long for the current software to convince newcomers
that genealogy is nothing more than a collection of names and dates, with a few
images thrown in for good measure.[^caveat]

Second, as wonderful as the [Genealogical Proof
Standard](http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html) is, we need
software that shows, as transparently as possible, what good research looks
like. People learn best with examples and feedback (and maybe with a teensy bit
of social pressure thrown in). We're working on this with Geungle and other
initiatives, but right now it is a lot of pioneering work.

While those two would be a good start, here are a few other things to keep in
mind:

* We need to accept the fact that this is research. Just because it is
  research, does not mean it is above our heads, or than we're not smart enough
  to participate. This is the study of life, of mankind, a domain in which all
  of us should have at least _some_ experience. But it _is_ research, and we
  need to treat it as such. We need to be reasoning things out and creating
  solid inferences that we wouldn't be afraid to stick our names on.
* Relationships between evidence and claims must be treated as first-class
  citizens by technology. It's the only real thing that we've got to go on most
  of the time, except for analyses (created by researchers) using that
  evidence. The chains of evidence that tie all the research together must be
  transparent (and exist).
* Just because it is in print (or pixel) does not mean it's true. The inverse
  also applies: just because you can enter it easily into a computer does not
  mean it becomes true.
* Reconstructing lives includes reconstructing the world in which these people,
  whom we're studying, lived. There must be room for experimentation and
  hypotheses, alternate or temporary realities, etc.
* Only _after_ you have all the pieces can you be really sure about what the
  puzzle is actually representing.
* If you follow the preceding point's logic further, that means that tools for
  genealogy must be founded on something other than identity, since identity
  must be proven first, by evidence.
* Questions must be studied in context. We cannot rip someone out of their
  world and expect to get a good understanding of who they were by studying
  their vital information alone.
* Answers must be articulated in a way that promotes understanding, deeper
  insight, and further research. Presenting good research is all about
  communication. It's an art. While a computer can help make this process
  easier, humans are still needed.

## A lofty goal

Now you may have a better idea now of what we are trying to accomplish with
Geungle. We are trying to reconstruct the entire history of mankind. This
touches upon every facet of mankind's sojourn on earth.

A loftly goal, you say? Yes! Unattainable? Probably, but there is a lot we can
do to understand the past even if we cannot reconstruct all of it...or even
come close. Dispicable? Well, there have been many ugly and dispicable things
that have happened throughout mankind's existence, and it is essential, when
studying someone's life, to understand, at least to some degree, all that they
experienced, the good and the bad. Fortunately, we don't have to experience it
all for ourselves, though we may surely empathize.

So where does the bigger research community fit into all of this?

As we've learned ourselves what genealogical research looks like, all those
nice generational tree structures fade into the background, and we're left with
similar types of semi-structured information that is found in any other
research field. There is [a lot of momentum](/blog/heading-to-oai8/) in the
general research community to develop open technological standards that are
domain agnostic. It totally makes sense to collaborate.
  
Maybe the biggest reason is that we can't do it alone. We need all the help we
can get. Only as we come to an understanding of each person's human experience
can we have any confidence in the outputs of our research. That is why we need
all the help we can get. We need to cooperate with other research fields
because they are trying to make sense of this world, too. We need their
research and they need our research.
{: .conclusion }

[^life]: 
    We've tried telling people that were writing software for [generational
    history](/blog/thoughts-about-rootstech-2012#what-is-a-user) or
    [microhistory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microhistory), but we've gotten
    a lot of blank looks, even from historians! When we say we're writing
    software for genealogy, people are _way_ more understanding.

[^caveat]: 

    It is important to note that there are many knowledgeable genealogists that
    come to the table with some sort of autonomous research framework who use
    these tools for various purposes, despite the tools' inherent limitations.
