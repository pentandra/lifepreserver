We blogged about [our mission a couple years ago], and it has been fascinating
to see how our understanding has grown over time.

All that we do in this company is motivated by our [mission], which is:

> To open up the knowledge of the world, so that light and understanding will
> be more accessible to everyone.

_We live in the information age. Why does knowledge need to be opened up?_

Knowledge is trapped right now in books, on the Web, and in people's heads.
Transferring knowledge from one person to another is harder than it needs to
be, often requiring a lot of background learning to explain something, because
the connections in logic are not linear. Research, at its essence, is simply
structured learning, and is the process of connecting pieces of information
together to create a new piece of knowledge. Knowledge needs to be accessible
in whatever way people think. We also need to be able to share knowledge in
more open, personal ways.

The <a href="#fig:squarehead">library pictured below</a> is a good metaphor for
the needs in society right now. The sculptor, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Sosno">Sacha Sosno</a>, used the art
of obliteration to leave it up to the viewer to imagine the rest the building.
Due to the design of this library, nobody can see into the building from the
outside, but the people inside can see out. Libraries are repositories of
knowledge. This library could be full of the most enjoyable literature, but
nobody would know that from looking at it. You would have to go inside and
peruse the selection to find out.

You could think of books, the Web, and people as libraries. All of these
things, including each of us, are vast repositories of knowledge. Yet our
ability to communicate this knowledge with each other is limited. Rather than
guessing what other people are thinking, as in Sosno's sculpture, we need the
ability to share what is in our heads!

I think it's interesting the the Web is a graph of nodes and edges, but we as
humans extract knowledge from it primarily by reading documents. While the Web
is a vast improvement over the printing press, we must constantly go through
the process of translating prose into information, and then connecting those
pieces of information into knowledge in a way that our minds can understand.
And then to write a web page, we need to translate our knowledge into prose
that someone else can later assimilate the same way. What would happen if we
used the Web in a different way? If we sidestepped this translation process and
dealt with knowledge on the Web directly?

In scholarly research the situation is more bleak. The research publication
process is too slow and isolated, not really having changed from what it was
<span class="oldstyle">350</span> years ago. Commercial publishers put articles
behind paywalls, charging <span class="oldstyle">$30--40</span> for access to
each. Researchers get none of the profits.  Even with access to an article,
very few of the underlying connections in logic are ever published, making it
hard for people to reproduce or build upon the research results. Even further,
research that doesn't turn out as hoped is normally not published, meaning that
all the research is lost, leading to a lot of duplication of work and wasted
efforts. It is as if we're only publishing a part of the picture, leaving the
rest up to the imagination.

Maybe my hope for the future has come from reading too much academic writing,
which most of the time doesn't deserve the distinction of prose. Most is not
enjoyable to read, and was probably not very enjoyable to write in the first
place. Beyond that, our systems of citations are rooted in a two-dimensional
world, and cannot grow beyond this limitation. While footnotes seem to be the
best tool that we currently have to describe the connections between pieces of
information, they are lousy at preserving the context and meaning of those
connections.

In general, we want to change how research is done and perceived. Research is
currently assumed to be the domain of the scholarly elite. In the future, we
see research as part of the everyday life of many types of people, from many
different backgrounds, contributing to the world's knowledge in many different
ways. You don't need to be a PhD to contribute meaningfully to the progress of
knowledge! Everyone knows different things and can bring a unique perspective
to a question. We are creating a research counterculture. You could compare
what we are doing to the World Wide Web. In the early <span
class="oldstyle">90</span>'s, the Web was the domain of technical academics.
Now the Web is cool, and everyone seems to be on the Web in some form or
fashion. Anyone can become a web developer, blogger, or contribute something in
some way, without anyone else's permission. Anyone—a curious student to a
tenured professor or a seasoned entrepreneur to an aspiring researcher in a
third-world country to a professional genealogist—should be able to share their
journey of discovery in a simple, open way. This mechanism should be simple
enough to track basic questions and answers, and should scale well enough to
handle complex, data-intensive research, such as studying heavy particle
collisions in the <a href="#fig:alice">Large Hadron Collider</a> at CERN. It
needs to open doors for collaboration within a research field and bridge fields
of knowledge that have traditionally been isolated. We need something that
allows anyone to publish every bit of the journey, from the most random piece
of evidence to the most profound analysis in real time, as the research is
progressing. And all this research needs to be accessible not only to people,
but to machines as well.  {: .conclusion }
