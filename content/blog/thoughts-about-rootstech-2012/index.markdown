A couple months ago I attended the second annual
[RootsTech](http://rootstech.org/ "rootstech.org") conference in Salt Lake
City. For those not familiar with RootsTech: it is a conference hosted by
[FamilySearch International](http://familysearch.org "familysearch.org") to
bring together genealogical software creators and users.

Since I never wrote about my experiences with RootsTech <span class="oldstyle">2011</span>,
I will try to summarize my thoughts about RootsTech in general in this article.
Some of my thoughts may not be specifically about RootsTech, but more of a
response to the current state of the genealogical software industry.

<!--MORE-->

First, kudos to FamilySearch for organizing RootsTech. Their efforts are making
a difference. A lot more dialog is going on between users and developers now
than in the past.

However, there is more than one type of user.

## What is a User?

Elizabeth Shown Mills describes three types of genealogists in her paper
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ngsgenealogy.org/galleries/Ref_Researching/NGSQVol91Pg26077GenealogyHistory.pdf"><cite>Genealogy in the "Information Age": History's New Frontier?</cite></a>:

> investigations_. Typically, they spurn documentation \[and\] evidence
> standards...because they are "just doing this for fun."

> <dfn id="def:traditional-genealogists">Traditional Genealogists</dfn>

> context.

> they correctly portray each human life they study.

Janet Havorka at RootsTech this year similarly described three types of
genealogists in her lecture [Advocating Genealogy and Growing the Market: Issues of the New Genealogist](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rootstech/original/Advocating%20Genealogy.docx?1322717131 "Click for Syllabus").
Havorka called these: new, seasoned, and professional. These categories roughly
correspond to Mills' categories above.

## User and Software Approaches

Whatever they are called, these types of genealogists approach genealogical
software in very different ways. When starting out with research, family tree
climbers don't really know what to do or where to start. They feel empowered
when they obtain some family tree software and create their first family tree.
Most generational historians, on the other hand, use a combination of ad hoc
methods, including word documents, filing cabinets, and spreadsheets, to keep
track of what they are doing.

There are changes happening in the genealogical software industry right now.
Many family tree climbers, at some point, realize that there is more to
genealogy than sticking names and dates on a pedigree chart. The
[National Genealogical Society](http://ngsgenealogy.org){: rel="external" },
[Board for Certification of Genealogists](http://bcgcertification.org/){: rel="external"},
and several other groups are doing much to teach people what good research
looks like. Yet most software companies are still not getting it.

To meet the needs of these various types of users, we need more than one type
of genealogy software. We also need a way to categorize genealogy software so
we can compare them fairly. Keep in mind that just like genealogists, deciding
to categorize a certain software as such and such is not a black and white
decision. Some fall in-between or have elements of all three types. I have
categorized genealogical software approaches into three groups that correspond
roughly to the types of genealogists mentioned above:

Genealogy 1.0

: This is your run-of-the-mill family tree software, sometimes referred to
(lovingly) as a record manager. Most of the genealogy software currently
available falls in this category.
<abbr title="GEnealogical Data COMmunication">GEDCOM</abbr> is the de facto
standard for this category of software.

Genealogy 2.0

: Sometimes called source-centric, this type of software is aware of the
genealogical research process, so that your research conclusions can be traced
back to the source documents from which you obtained the information to use as
evidence. FamilySearch is pushing hard for
<a href="http://gedcomx.org/" rel="external"><abbr>GEDCOM X</abbr></a>
to be the standard for this type of software.

Genealogy 3.0

: Designed to support the highest level of research, this type of software can
help reconstruct the past in its complexity. It is not limited to the vital
statistics of people on a tree, but understands the context of someone's life
in the world in which they lived. Without this comprehensive understanding of
the past, "we do not have the context we need to insure that our assertions are
accurate."[^1] This type of software integrates openly with software from other
domains, such as history and other social sciences.

Some software companies are just starting to scratch the surface of Genealogy
<span class="oldstyle">2.0</span>. As [more tools](/products/#geungle) become
available that support traditional genealogists and generational historians, we
will see the gap between new and professional genealogists narrow. Tools that
work the way research works will help new genealogists comprehend the research
process better and faster.

## Users at RootsTech

So what has this to do with users at RootsTech? Because of the software
currently being offered by genealogical vendors, it is not surprising that the
distribution of user types at RootsTech was a little skewed. It seemed that
professional genealogists or historians were few and far between. There were
exceptions, of course; a few stalwart professionals did come. Yet I wonder
about the future of RootsTech when such an important group, the only group that
really understands the full breadth of the domain, was noticeably sparse. Why
has RootsTech been unable to attract this vital group of people?

RootsTech right now seems to be more about tech marketing and less about real
genealogical research. Many of the people coming to RootsTech are on the
beginner side. While attracted to the technology, they also want to be exposed
to real genealogical research and learn how to do it. In this desire, some
attendees left disappointed. But it does not have to be this way.

People don't want genealogy sugar-coated. They want to know what _really_
happened to their _real_ ancestors. Why spend all the time, money, and energy
on this research if you have no clue what you are doing? It is a steep learning
curve to go from total novice to professional level with a solid understanding
of the [how's and why's of research](/research/process/). We're hoping that we
can make this transition a little easier.

I have found the lectures by professional genealogists at NGS conferences _so
much more useful to me_ as a developer and certainly as a genealogist. I just
can't get enough of the methodology track. Yet I have seen very few developers at
these conferences take advantage of the professional genealogical education
offered.

I love the idea of RootsTech and fully support its goals, but as long as
RootsTech fails to draw the experts in the field of genealogy, it will not be
building the bridges that need to be built. I hope that RootsTech can take the
next step.
