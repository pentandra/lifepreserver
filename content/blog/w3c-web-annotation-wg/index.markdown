We are thrilled that one of the core building blocks that we are using for
Geungle made it into a [W3C Working Group](http://www.w3.org/annotation/)
yesterday! It has been a long road up to this point, and there is still a good
ways to go, but this is a great achievement none the less.

potential to revolutionize the way that research is published. They are domain
agnostic. They are lightweight and distributed. They are awesome.
