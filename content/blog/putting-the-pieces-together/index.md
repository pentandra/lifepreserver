Last week I had the opportunity to participate in the second workshop of the
Defining the Scholarly Commons project (I covered the first workshop in [an
earlier blog posting][reimagining]). As you can tell from the squiggly line
above, our course has not been linear, neither has it been smooth sailing. We
have learned a lot, however, and even made some progress in the meantime.

<!--MORE-->

For our steering committee, this workshop was one we have been truly
anticipating, the culmination of a lot of thought and discussion of some very
fundamental matters. As can be expected, many of us embarked upon this project
from different places and with different expectations, and it seems that all of
these various diverging streams of thought converged on the inputs and outputs
of this one workshop. It was good that the workshop was held on the top floor
of a fifteen-story building, with many windows, plenty of fresh air, and a nice
balcony upon which to exercise [the law of two feet].

(Picture of the fog)

Despite a somewhat rocky beginning, I am happy that the atmosphere did open up,
especially by the second day, and people were able to share and participate in
what mattered to them.

# A _global_ commons?

We thought it was an cool coincidence that this workshop so far has been
Spanish themed. We went from Madrid to San Diego, and were able to use the
colors of each city flag in designing the workshop logos, and it just worked.
However, in this I think there is stuff we can learn from history to not
repeat, but try a different way. And I think this is a fundamental opportunity
we have here, and we need to do it right.

Looking at [the map](#fig:journey-of-defining) from more of an _evil_ point of
view, our journey from Madrid to San Diego could be thought of as a journey of
_conquest_. Isn't this path the same path that [Juan Rodr√≠guez
Cabrillo][cabrillo] and [others][vizcaino] took as they claimed land for Spain?
The difference is that we are not conquistadores and we are not trying to
create an [encomienda] system[^citizen_science] here! Far from it! 

An alternative example of an early colony that has some similarities to what
we're trying to accomplish here are what we refer to now in the United States
as the Pilgrims. This colony actually sticks out in history because it did
something no other colony had ever done before. The people from the old country
came for a very different reason than most. They were not entrepreneurs or
determined to conquer indigenous peoples, but were fleeing religious
persecution. They wanted freedom to practice religion the way they believed.
This change how they approached problems, and with much patience and
determination they were able to develop relationships of mutual respect with
the indigenous peoples. They learned from each other. They helped each other.
They created a new culture together and had such an impact that in this area of
the world we still celebrate this amazing achievement in our [Thanksgiving
holiday][thanksgiving]. And although it wasn't perfect, they showed the world
that what they did was possible.

Now what we're doing here is not religious in nature, but I do see similarities
in the motivations and desires between the two. Many are stuck in a system
where they don't have freedom to practice they way they would like to. In
saying this, I'm not trying to say that being able to publish something open
access is as important as the free practice of religion, or that professional
researchers have suffered as much as those early Christians, who sometimes gave
up everything to follow their beliefs. But I see an opportunity here to do
something that never has been done before, something that would improve the
lives of everyone, and to do it for the right reasons. The Scholarly Commons
would not only give more freedom to the the professional researchers, but would
make knowledge itself more free and abundant.

      That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for
      the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his
      condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by
      nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without
      lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we
      breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or
      exclusive appropriation.

## An agreement to unite

I see what we're trying to accomplish with the _principles_ of the Scholarly
Commons as similar to what we know of the circumstances surrounding the signing
of the [Mayflower Compact]: people with significant differences (in this case
significant religious differences, in our case the differences are more
diverse) coming together to carve out a new way of approaching life---a new way
of living together. Something that they never had before experienced in any
place they had ever lived.

<figure id="fig:the-mayflower-compact" class="img" property="schema:image" typeof="schema:ImageObject">

  <figcaption class="small">The signing of the Mayflower Compact resembles the journey we are on to converge upon the principles of the Scholarly Commons.</figcaption>
</figure>

The passengers of the Mayflower created the compact because there were those
that said they "would use their own liberty; for none had power to command
them."[^bradford] They were wanting to go it on their own, every man for
himself. Others thought it would be better to cooperate and help each other. In
the end, they (thankfully) all consented to the latter for the sake of order
and survival, and, I think the opportunity to do something that very few of
their predecessors had ever had the opportunity to do: deliberately coming
together and _creating their own government_. Just think of it!

It wasn't what was _in_ the document that mattered as much as the fact that the
mere existence of the document witnessed of the processes that went in to
producing it. _The processes_ defined the social contract. The document was
just evidence of the contract, something to which those who agreed to abide by
it could look to and remember back.

## Our great decision

What's wrong with just going at this on our own? Why not just let things go as
they have done, and hope that it all works out? Isn't the laissez-faire
approach good enough? Why is it so important that we come together and build a
commons?

Quite frankly, I don't think any of our current approaches have had the power
to transform the current systems of scholarship. We need something more,
something that is so amazing that it would transform the world, something that
others will see and say, "Why don't we work like that?" I think of the words of
Alexander Hamilton, many years after these 

<figure id="fig:hamilton" class="bq grab">
  <blockquote>
    <p>

      It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to
      the people of this country, to decide by their conduct and example, the
      important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of
      establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they
      are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on
      accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis at
      which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the period when
      that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall
      act may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune
      of mankind.

    </p>

I see the Scholarly Commons as one of the most wonderful opportunities that has
ever presented itself to mankind. For all the good intentions of those of
earlier times, they never had the technology to pull off something like a
global commons of researchers, sharing as they go, almost instantaneously, the
collective research of the world, ever expanding.

What is our underlying motivation to create a commons? What is our order and
survival? First of all, I see the Scholarly Commons as a relief for the
burgeoning cadre of post-docs. Many opportunities for work and service that do
not now exist will be opened up. Second, this will open up opportunities for
many more people to become involved in scholarly and scientific research. No
longer will people need to be affiliated with an institution to have access to
the latest research efforts. This will stimulate discovery in a way that I
think we can't comprehend right now. This has the potential to drastically
improve and save lives.

The fact that these conversations are happening is a good thing. We're all
coming at this from where we are. But is there any other place from which we
_could_ come? These conversations are the beginning of the commons! They have
to happen, and the important thing is that we create a culture of learning:
that we're willing to learn and grow and change as we go. This new land that we
have embarked upon is full of ripe possibility, but for the sake of order and
survival, it would be advantageous to do it in a way that gives as many people
a voice as possible What is important is that we involve everyone in this
defining process so we can create something well-rounded and balanced. We need
something that everyone can touch.

# TL;DR

So I had an assignment to write my thoughts in less than <span
class="oldstyle">400</span> words as to what the Scholarly Commons _is_ and the
direction that we go next for the principles. If you've made it this far in
this post, you have realized how far I have failed. But if I was to sum up my
thoughts into a very high-level statement of what the Scholarly Commons is,
here's what I would say:

{:.big}

The Scholarly Commons is _an agreement_ to come together and unite in matters
of practice and governance to create a commons for the good of anyone involved
in scholarly or scientific knowledge. The Scholarly Commons is also _an
opportunity_ to make the world a better place by doing these things better than
we have ever done them before.

{:.conclusion}

As for the principles, I think we need to involve more people in the
development of them.

    Actually I've been thinking more and more that the term _citizen science_
    doesn't go far enough, and sometimes I worry that the practice ends up
    resembling an [encomienda] system more than I would like.
