Recently I had an opportunity to participate in an unusual workshop thanks to
[FORCE11] and the [Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust][helmsley].
This workshop is first in a series of workshops and exercises organized for the
purpose of _defining the scholarly commons_, and this program is really the
culmination of the desires of many to change how research is preserved and
communicated. As you could probably guess, I am so excited to be a part of this
movement! Because I am on the steering committee for [this working
group][commons group], I have had the opportunity to observe both the
foreground as well as the behind-the-scenes efforts. I want to share some of my
impressions from both perspectives.

Before doing so, I wanted to express how fortunate we feel to be involved in
FORCE11! When we started this company, we mainly focused on solving these
problems with technology. It did not take long to realize that "if you build
it, they will come" is really _not_ how it works in large-scale organizational
migrations like this! While the right technology is needed, the social
challenges are at least <span class="oldstyle">1000</span> times more difficult
to overcome than the technical ones! But we also discovered that they are not
impossible to overcome either. Actually, in a way, I think that helping people
become united in a common purpose and heading in a common direction is the only
_real_ challenge that there is. Once we're there we will have a shared vision
of what needs to be built, and once it is built we will all know how well it
embodies that collective vision. FORCE11 is taking this challenge by the horns,
and doing so in a general (not domain-specific) way.

With this program, including the workshops and other exercises, the overarching
question we hope to answer is this: _are we ready to define a scholarly commons?_

## Preparations for a workshop

One of the first questions that we considered in preparation for this workshop
was do we steer the direction of the workshop and issuing outputs, or do we
leave it open for people to create whatever they think the future is? I have to
admit that there were times that I fought back at the idea, wanting to teach or
indoctrinate concepts from commons theory during the workshop, and then use
theory to design the commons from the top down. But we decided the later, to
leave it completely up to the participants to design. We really had no clue to
how it would turn out! Was it worth it? To me, I think this was the single best
decision that we made in the design of the workshop. Everyone owned what they
came up with, and even competed with other groups.

Positivity.

We did select participants that we knew were likely to have thought about these
things before, that were involved somehow in this future-thinking already. We
wanted a good mix of thought-leaders and young people. We also wanted a
balanced representation of stakeholders from scholarly communities,
disciplines, gender, and geographic locations around the globe.

## Outcomes and continuations

Almost everyone that we invited turned up. I think we had one last-minute
cancellation. Jeroen Bosman and Bianca Kramer did an excellent job designing
the workshop. I think it was stimulating for everyone (maybe even a little too
engaging for some people). Dinner on Friday night was delicious, but I was not
prepared for the late Spanish dinners! I think we were done by 11:30PM!

I think everyone present was in agreement that we are ready to define the
scholarly commons. The next questions to answer include: _how do we define the
commons? And how do we do this in a way that truly opens the door as wide as we
can, so everyone feels included and is able to play a part in creating the
commons?_
