We're excited to announce that in June we're heading to the CERN
Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication in Geneva, Switzerland to
present a poster on our forthcoming open-source research framework, ROC.

CERN is a very appropriate place for us to introduce ROC for two reasons.
First, much of the research that is being done at CERN is to increase our
understanding of what I would call _inner space_, or, the atom. When I think of
outer space, I think of NASA; when I think of inner space, I think of CERN.
Much of our work as a company is to understand and model the [fundamental unit
of research](/research/process/#sec:unit-of-research): the _case_.

<!--MORE-->

The second reason is that CERN is the birthplace of the [World Wide
Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). In <span
class="oldstyle">1990</span>, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau,
[proposed](http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html) to develop a system that would use
hypertext as "a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of
nodes in which the user can browse at will."[^1] Kind of a cool idea, isn't it?

The semantic web builds on this idea, but instead of linking _web pages_
together, hypertext is used to link _data_ together. In a way, what we are
doing takes it a step further, linking the various elements of _research_
together.

Without the contributions of these two men and thousands of others, there is no
way that we could even _imagine_ trying to accomplish what we are working on
now.

Thank you, all!
