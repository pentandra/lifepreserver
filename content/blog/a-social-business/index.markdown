We have had an identity crisis lately as we have tried to figure out who we
really are as a company. Since the beginning of this whole venture, we have
felt like we have been straddling the fence between a profit and non-profit
organization in our desires to promote research and grow in the way we envision
yet have the community support that is so critical in the future of research.
We wanted a business structure that took the best parts from both!

<!--MORE-->

We have a <a href="/company#mission">mission</a> that is really the
most important reason that we are doing this to begin with---and we believe in
it. We are so excited about it. But at the same time we have some great
business ideas to promote this new paradigm of research. We don't want to have
to deal with the funding limitations and red tape of the <span
class="oldstyle">501</span>(c)<span class="oldstyle">(3)</span>. We just want
to focus on our mission. On the other hand, we don't want the fact that we are
a for-profit company to deter people from supporting what we are doing.

Originally, we felt strongly about doing this as a for-profit company so we
would have the flexibility we need to do whatever it took to promote our
mission, and also so we could generate sufficient profits to extend our reach
for good as far as we can. We wanted to be self-sufficient and not have to
worry about the success of the next fundraising campaign.

Having gone down this path, one thing we have wondered about is how do we rally
researchers, scholars, academics, and others behind us if we are a for-profit
company? Isn't this the domain of the not-for-profits? 

After thinking about it some more, I thought of some companies that I have come
to admire. All of them are run by people who have a higher vision for what
business can be. These are good companies started by good people that think
businesses can be more than heartless profit machines. They have what is
sometimes referred to as a double or triple bottom line (people, planet,
profit). One such business, Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc. (you know, the yummy
ice cream), gives <span class="oldstyle">7.5</span> percent of their before-tax
profits to charity and purchases brownies from a bakery that hires people from
prison.  Newman's Own Inc. contributes all profits to charity. How can we be
more like them?

In a way, it's funny to think about this right now. We are still pre-revenue.
Yet, I think _now_ is the time to make these decisions. Funding choices made
early in a company's existence can limit options later on. In general, tech
companies are not known for their philanthropy and humanitarian generosities.
In too many instances, they are characterized more by a high-velocity scramble
to reach the next round of funding, at the same time giving little thought to
what it takes to actually build a self-sufficient, lasting enterprise. Burnout
hits too soon for too many. Much of this problem stems from the dog-eat-dog
world of venture capital investing. Does it have to be this way?

## Social What?

I must admit, they didn't teach us much about this in business school. When I
first heard of [social
enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise), I thought it was
referring to an organization that is really good at using Facebook. Nope. In
this context, social refers to society---as in _for the good of society_. It
turns out this is a label for the type of business that we are trying to build!
I cannot tell you how thrilled I was to find out that [a social enterprise can
be structured as a for-profit
company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_business).

According to Wikipedia,

> a <dfn id="socialbusiness">social business</dfn> is a non-loss, non-dividend
> company designed to address a social objective within the highly regulated
> marketplace of today.  It is distinct from a non-profit because the business
> should seek to generate a modest profit but this will be used to expand the
> companyâ€™s reach, improve the product or service or in other ways to subsidize
> the social mission.

YES!!! We finally found out who we are! The pieces are starting to fit together
now. We _can_ use the power of business to help solve the problems with
research! It is funny, since this doesn't drastically change our plans or
approach, but, hey, I'll take validation wherever I can find it! It is nice to
know what type of company we are and to be able to tell someone else now, too.
This definition is very much in line with what we have hoped to build this
company to be. And I think it gives us some stuff to work on and much more
focused direction to take.

We are not alone in this. A non-profit by the name of [B
Lab](http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps)
has created a certification (and an actual entity through legislation in some
states) called a <abbr>B Corporation</abbr>, or benefit corporation. They say,
"By voluntarily meeting higher standards of transparency, accountability, and
performance, Certified <abbr>B Corps</abbr> are distinguishing themselves in a
cluttered marketplace by offering a positive vision of a better way to do
business." They have put together a governance model to make being a better
business easier and more transparent.  We are excited at the prospect of
becoming a <abbr>B Corporation</abbr> in the future, so stay tuned!

You may argue, "But is research good for society?" If you're reading this post,
I probably don't have to convince you of that.[^goodforsociety]

[^goodforsociety]: It is thanks to research that the Internet and this post has
    been brought to you today. A better question might be, "Is this _post_ good
    for society?"
