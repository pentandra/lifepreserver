We had a blast last month at the 
[RootsTech](http://rootstech.org/ "rootstech.org") conference in Salt Lake City.
If you are not familiar with RootsTech, it is a conference organized mostly by 
[FamilySearch International](http://familysearch.org "familysearch.org") to 
bring together genealogical software creators and users. This is the second
year of the conference.

I never did get to write about my experiences with RootsTech 2011, so I will
try to summarize my thoughts about RootsTech in general in this post. Some of
my thoughts may not be about RootsTech at all, but more a response to the
current state of the genealogical software industry.

First, kudos to FamilySearch for organizing RootsTech. Their goal was to bring
software users and software developers together, and I think they have been
successful, in a way, in reaching it. There is a whole lot more dialog going on
between users and developers than there has been in the past.

However, there is more than one type of user (though developers are all kind
of the same ;) ). 

Elizabeth Shown Mills has described three types of genealogists (each of which
could also be a software user):[^1]

Family Tree Climbers

: Many are avid toilers, but they _collect_ rather than _conduct
investigations_. Typically, they spurn documentation, evidence
standards...because they are "just doing this for fun."

Traditional Genealogists

: As serious compilers of family data, most strive to meet the standards set
forth by the Jacobus School in the 1930s...Their goal is likely to produce
"compiled genealogies" that are _reference_ works rather than _family
histories_, so they try to identify as many family members as possible, with
vital statistics but little or no historical context.

Generational Historians

: Individuals of this mindset thirst for historical knowledge in all its
cultural, economic, legal, religious, and social contexts...They value the
difference between gathering names and reconstructing lives...Their measure of
success is not the number of family members found, but the extent to which they
correctly portray each human life they study.


Janet Havorka similarly described three types of genealogists in her lecture
[Advocating Genealogy and Growing the Market: Issues of the New Genealogist](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rootstech/original/Advocating%20Genealogy.docx?1322717131 "Click for Syllabus"),
in which they were labeled new, seasoned, and professional.

What was the distribution of these user "types" at RootsTech? I am not sure,
but I *do* know that there were very few professionals on the speaker list. I
know that RootsTech is primarily a tech conference, but given the goal of
bringing technology users and creators together, I wonder why RootsTech has
been unable to attract the professionals. 

So long as RootsTech fails to draw the professionals, it will not be building
the bridges that need to be built.

Two ideas come to mind for drawing the professionals to this conference:

1. Offer compensation to the lecturers. At least for the cost of travel.
1. Stop sugar-coating genealogical research. Give depth to the conference
   instead of side-stepping the hard stuff. Shouldn't the tech be built upon a
   solid understanding of the problem domain?

While there were some great technology sessions, I know that some users came
hoping to learn how to do real genealogical research. I am afraid that they left
disappointed.
