We had a blast last month at the 
[RootsTech](http://rootstech.org/ "rootstech.org") conference in Salt Lake City.
If you are not familiar with RootsTech, it is a conference organized mostly by 
[FamilySearch International](http://familysearch.org "familysearch.org") to 
bring together genealogical software creators and users. This is the second
year of the conference.

## Things I Learned

### GEDCOM X
{: .big }

I learned for the first time about an effort that FamilySearch has been working
on for the past few years. 

I really don't understand why some want to _dumb down_ genealogical research.
This research is, by nature, a scholarly activity. Other scholarly fields are
trying to find solutions to some of the same problems. We need to bridge the
void.

I would have loved to see more research-focused classes. 

## Response

### Genealogy is Coming Out

Genealogy has been a niche endeavor for many years. However, genealogists are
not the only ones with these problems. Historians are grappling with some of
the same problems. Yet these two groups continue to work in isolation. While
genealogy has had a somewhat sordid past, it has really changed over the last
fifty years

However, as Janet Havorka mentioned in her
[session](http://rootstech.org/schedule/saturday/TU031 "Advocating Genealogy and Growing the Market: Issues of the New Genealogist"),
there are at least three different types of genealogists: new, seasoned, and 
professional. I would add then that there are at least that many different types of
users. 

What was the distribution of these user "types" at RootsTech? I am not sure,
but I *do* know that there were very few professionals on the speaker list. I
know that RootsTech is primarily a technology conference, but given the goal of
bringing technology users and creators together, I wonder why RootsTech has
been unable to attract the professionals. How much better could collaboration
be if more professional researchers were there too? It is likely that the fact
that the speakers do not get paid contributes to this outcome.

This makes the genealogy community unique compared to the digital
archive or library communities.

While there were some great technology sessions, I feel that some users came
hoping to learn how to do real genealogical research. I am afraid that they left
disappointed.
