We had a blast last week at the 
[RootsTech](http://rootstech.org/ "rootstech.org") conference in Salt Lake City.
If you are not familiar with RootsTech, let me say that it is an attempt by 
[FamilySearch International](http://familysearch.org "familysearch.org") to 
bring together genealogical software creators and users. I think they have been
successful, in a way, in reaching this goal.

However, as Janet Havorka mentioned in her
[session](http://rootstech.org/schedule/saturday/TU031 "Advocating Genealogy and Growing the Market: Issues of the New Genealogist"),
there are at least three different types of genealogists: new, seasoned, and 
professional. I would add then that there are at least that many different types of
users. 

What was the distribution of these user "types" at RootsTech? I am not sure,
but I *do* know that there were very few professionals on the speaker list. I know
that RootsTech is primarily a technology conference, but given the goal of
bringing technology users and creators together, I wonder why RootsTech has been
unable to attract the professionals. How much better could collaboration be if more
professional researchers were there too?[^1]

This makes the genealogy community unique compared to the digital
archive or library communities.

While there were some great technology sessions, I feel that some users came
hoping to learn how to do real genealogical research. I am afraid that they left
disappointed.

[^1]: It is likely that the fact that the speakers do not get paid contributes to this outcome.
