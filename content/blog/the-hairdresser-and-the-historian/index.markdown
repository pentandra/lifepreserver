I don't know much about hairdos, especially those that were in vogue
<span class="oldstyle">1500</span> years ago. But it turns out that the experts
may not have known everything either. Yesterday on the front page of the Wall
Street Journal was a story[^1] about a very unusual hairdresser.

What is so cool to me is that someone down in the trenches---not in the ivory
tower---figured it out.
