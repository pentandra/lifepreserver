For the past couple of months we've had the chance to participate in the [Grow
America](http://web.archive.org/web/20120621062316/http://www.growam.com/){:
rel="external" } Springboard competition.  It was tough to decide if we should
enter, since our time is already spread so thin. However, like-it-or-not, it
takes money to run a business, and this felt like a good fit. Looking back, we
are really glad that we entered. We did not win any money, but we learned a lot
and gained confidence in our ability to communicate what we are doing to
business folks (especially when they're not research geeks).

It was inspiring and enlightening to see other entrepreneurs going through the
same things we're going through. We're not the only ones that are young and
somewhat inexperienced, but trying to fill "executive" shoes. We're just normal
people trying to make something out of an idea we believe in. Seeing these
other companies succeed gave us that "if they can do it, we can do it" feeling.

Seeing the companies that are a little further along than we are gave us a
vision of the next steps we need to take. Some of these steps are exciting and
some are a little intimidating. It's exciting to think about actually having
our [first product](/solutions/#geungle) out there, in the hands of the people
that want it, and to start making a difference! It's intimidating to realize
that we need to build partnerships with other businesses. It's easy for us to
connect with like-minded people, but business-to-business is a whole new
ballgame for us.

The actual competition process helped us as well in two ways.

First, it reminded us of something we already know: *our business plan needs to
be a living document, not something that we dust off once a year*. When we were
writing our business plan for the first time, we talked about that, but we
apparently needed a reminder. With each round of the competition we would have
new insights about our business or a slightly new way to look at what we are
doing. It's not that what we were making big changes, but we received deeper
insights, like baby steps of refinement. Thinking through the big picture again
validated our thoughts and helped us make sure we were staying on track with
our goals. Had anything gotten in the way? Were we missing something important?

Second, we had to step way outside our comfort zone during some parts of the
competition. We've wanted to take on video production for various things in the
past, but have never felt like we had the skillset to do it. As part of the
second round of the competition, we needed to submit a [two-minute video](#growam-video).
So guess what?! We learned! It may not be ready for an Oscar nomination, but we
thought it was pretty good for three days of crash-course-style experience. (It
also got us out of a jam when we had technical difficulties at NGS because we
were able to fall back on the video we had created for the competition.) It's
given us confidence to take on a video in the future (hopefully with a little
more time to put it together). The other major way we were thrown outside of
our comfort zone came in the final round.  We pitched to an angel investor. We
have never done that before and the thought had always been scary. Now that
we've done it, it's not that intimidating anymore. They asked us hard
questions, and we were able to answer them with confidence. The more questions
they asked, the more I felt validated in our business approach and decisions.

The competition also gave me an even greater appreciation for those that are in
fields of research. Research is challenging in any field. It is also
challenging to explain research to someone that has never done it before---let
alone explain it in <span class="oldstyle">2--3</span> minutes.

Overall, this experience gave me encouragement to take those next steps. I
recognize now more than ever that we *can* be successful. There is nothing
stopping us.

P.S.---Another random realization: adrenaline can make up for a lot of lack in
sleep. But the letdown after the adrenaline stops is brutal.
