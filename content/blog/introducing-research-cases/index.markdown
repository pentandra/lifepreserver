## Motives of Correspondence

For the last <span class="oldstyle">350</span> or so years we have relied on
journals for the dissemination of scholarly news. Yet journals were only a
complement to the communications method already in use at the time:
_correspondence by letter_. The journal was a labor-saving device to distribute
the latest research news en masse to the public. However, as a communications
medium, journals allow only one-way discourse and lack many of the advantages
of interaction and collaboration that correspondence provided.

The [Republic of Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters)
was an international network of philosophical collaborators during the <span
class="oldstyle">17</span>th and <span class="oldstyle">18</span>th centuries.
Letters were exchanged in a quasi-public manner between interested parties.
Leisure time, money for postage, and a curious mind were the only barriers for
entry into this network, though because of cultural barriers that existed at
the time, the Republic was mostly comprised of gentlemen---lady
[interlocutors][Interlocutor] were quite rare.

This happy looking gentleman, [Antonie van Leeuwenhoek], is regarded by many as
the father of microbiology. Among other things, he discovered bacteria and a
method to drastically improve the power of a microscope. Yet he published zero
papers or books. He relied on the open and effective method of scientific
communication and collaboration, correspondence by letter, exchanging over
<span class="oldstyle">560</span> letters with the Royal Society during the
course of his life. Leeuwenhoek is widely regarded as an amateur, and I believe
that he would appreciate that designation, because he did his research to
satisfy his curiosity---for the love of it.

## Publish or Perish

If those involved in the Republic of Letters had something that worked so well,
namely correspondence by letter, what were the motives for creating the
journal?

As it turns out, many of these early decisions to create the journal and
centralize scientific communications were driven simply by economics. It was
cheaper to disseminate scientific news using the printing press rather than
employing an army of copyists.

In early <span class="oldstyle">1665</span> Henry Oldenburg obtained a copy of
the newly published Journal des sçavans. It prompted a business idea. If he
could create a journal entirely devoted to natural philosophy (or science), he
would be able to more easily promote new scientific ideas, broaden the reach of
the Royal Society, and perhaps even make a little bit of money on the side. In
other words, Oldenburg wanted to maximize the scale of dissemination of
scientific news by minimizing the friction that existed in the system.[^neylon]
Thus started the Philosophical Transactions. His plan worked except for the
money part, though he made just enough to cover his rent.

While journals have been very successful at disseminating research news, they
have also promoted an attitude of fierce competition and the social consequent
of *publish or perish*. The printing process has entrenched the subtle yet
devastating ideas that research must be finished before it is shared and that
peer review is a one-time ordeal. Researchers are incentivized to hold back
until they have everything figured out to increase their chances of getting
published. The commercialization of research and the journal publication
industry has only exacerbated the problem.

The economics of the journal have led to an environment of centralization in
which research outputs funnel through the publisher. Eventually, the economics
of the machine won. More efficient was it to disseminate scientific news to a
broad audience using a printing press than it was to keep up this one-to-one,
direct style of interaction. The quest for notoriety has also played a part,
with researchers seeking to become published to secure opportunities for future
funding. Publishers became the de facto gatekeepers of knowledge, and the
orchestrators of peer review.

Where has this led us?

* To a funding model for research that is tied to the publishing process, to
  which researchers are slaves.[^codrington]
* To a false sense of scarcity as publishers are forced to select a limited
  number of what they think are *the best* papers to publish to control
  publishing costs. Then we have to live with the overhead and time delays of
  the publishing process.
* Research is now more about dissertation than discourse.
* Researchers have become silos themselves (or in small groups) to protect
  their own interests.
* All the above kinda takes the fun out of research. 

Is this what we want? I don't think so.

## Research Cases

Let's step back a bit. The Republic of Letters was an amazing success. What can
we learn from those early days of scientific correspondence?

Andrea Rusnock said,

  <blockquote cite="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4028081">
    <p>

      While publication and distribution of the Philosophical Transactions
      certainly contributed to the diffusion of knowledge, it did not provide for
      the flexibility, openness, manoeuvrability and relative rapidity of
      interaction that correspondence did. In short, the Society’s correspondence
      encouraged a more participatory science.

Is there some way we could superimpose our modern technology on the motives
that drove members of the Republic of Letters to collaborate so eagerly?
Couldn't we create something even *more* valuable than the original Republic
because we have technology that they didn't? Technology that excels at
communication? Technology that allows us to collaborate economically in more
direct and differentiated ways?

What would this technology look like? If all we needed was a modern version of
correspondence, it seems that email and mailing lists would have taken over
that role by now. Blogs and wikis are good at disseminating content, but they
have not successfully replaced the journal either. Why haven't these
technologies replaced the journal already? The subtle, yet obvious reason is
that the dissemination of content is not enough. Dissemination is not valuable
enough in its own right to warrant widespread change in the way we do research.
As a research community, we're missing something important. Something that
we've lost. Something that is worth changing for, something that would
accelerate research like nothing else would. Never before in the history of our
world has knowledge and enlightenment been so freely available to all. Never
before have so many joined the ranks of the curious. Yet while they want to
participate in the creation of knowledge, modern-day researchers shouldn't need
to jump through the hoops of traditional journal publishers anymore. Journals
are just not the labor-saving device they used to be.

Research cases is a vision for a new kind of research---a research that is more
participative, similar in spirit to the network of correspondence that existed
during the <span class="oldstyle">17</span>th and <span
class="oldstyle">18</span>th centuries.

As a social business, one of our goals is to lower the barriers for people of
all disciplines, subjects, and skill levels to be able to contribute to the
world's knowledge in meaningful ways. We envision the future of research being
based upon open Web standards and [open, domain-specific collaborative research
platforms](/research/#sec:future). We see the publishers of the future as the
developers and providers of these platforms.

What would this future look like? Here are some principles that we think should
be part of the future of research:

* Research has a trajectory and a rhythm that drives it forward.
  Quasi-informal, open, flexible, in-process research is composed of many
  smaller pieces brought together over time. These individual pieces need to be
  published in context with fine-grained attribution for all contributions
  made. Research shared this way would lower the administrative overhead for
  grantors and grantees, and open the door to micro-grants and other
  alternative funding models, which would enable greater maneuverability to
  follow the direction that the research leads.
* We need to get away from the monoculture of the journal article as the only
  community-sanctioned format of publication and value a diversity of
  approaches. Researchers should own their own research and control how it is
  shared, though there *may* be an exception to this if the research was funded
  by a third party.
* Direct, public, and rapid interaction between any and all interested
  researchers removes the need to go through a middleman for scholarly
  discourse. This direct collaboration should include questioning and digging
  deeper into each others' arguments.
* Research is not an elitist activity, and should be open to anyone who desires
  to participate and contribute, whatever the skill level. All contributions
  can be transparently judged based on merit. Above all, *research should be
  fun!* If the fun is not inherent in the research itself, it should at least
  exist as a feeling of camaraderie amongst fellow discoverers.[^franklin]
* Feedback and peer-review need to be introduced much earlier and continue
  throughout the research process. As James Jurin said, 'All reasonings [should
  be left] to the judgement of the Publick, to whom indeed it properly
  belongs.'[^jurin]

We invite anyone interested [to participate](http://researchcases.org "Help out with Research Cases").

## Notes

[^codrington]: 

    It may be more than coincidence that the All Souls Library was created
    through the bequest of [Christopher
    Codrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Codrington), who
    amassed his fortune through the slave trade.

[^jurin]:

    After Henry Oldenburg's prolific tenure as secretary of the Royal Society,
    several subsequent secretaries could not keep up with the volume and
    diversity of correspondence, so correspondence stagnated. James Jurin came
    along in the <span class="oldstyle">1720</span>s, and revived the society's
    correspondence. He was so successful that he couldn't handle the volume of
    correspondence after a while. In <span class="oldstyle">1752</span> the
    Committee of Papers was established to spread the load across the
    institution.

[^neylon]:

    Cameron Neylon wrote [an excellent blog
    post](http://cameronneylon.net/blog/network-enabled-research/) about the
    future of research that parallels Oldenburg's experience
    <span class="oldstyle">350</span> years earlier.

[^franklin]:

    To get a glimpse into the openness and camaraderie that existed at the
    beginning of the [Enlightenment], even to the open sharing of ideas,
    preliminary data, and thoughts that were not completely thought out, here's
    an excerpt from a letter from [Benjamin Franklin] to [Peter Collinson] in
    <span class="oldstyle">1753</span>:

    <figure class="bq grab">
      <blockquote>
        <p>

        These Thoughts, my dear Friend, are many of the crude and hasty, and if
        I were merely ambitious of acquiring some Reputation in Philosophy, I
        ought to keep them by me, 'till corrected and improved by Time and
        farther Experience. But since even short Hints, and imperfect
        Experiments in any new Branch of Science, being communicated, have
        oftentimes a good Effect, in exciting the attention of the Ingenious to
        the Subject, and so becoming the Occasion of more exact disquisitions
        (as I before observed) and more compleat Discoveries, you are at
        Liberty to communicate this Paper to whom you please; it being of more
        Importance that Knowledge should increase, than that your Friend should
        be thought an accurate Philosopher.
