We have not really sought after venture capitalists at this point. VCs seem to
be mostly hype marketing companies. Most seem to be interested in promoting
whomever they have chosen, for the good or bad of the consumer. We are trying
to meet a real need that is already out there. I would rather build a community
of people that care more about our vision and products than how much money we
raised in the last round. Yes, that means that it is up to us to build that
community. It may take longer, but it will be more real.
