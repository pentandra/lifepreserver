I don't know much about hairdos, especially those that were in vogue <span
class="oldstyle">1500</span> years ago. But it turns out that the experts may
not have known everything there is to know about them either. Last week, on the
front page of the Wall Street Journal was [a
story](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324900204578286272195339456.html)[^1]
about a very unusual hairdresser named Janet Stephens.

Ms. Stephens is a hairdresser by trade, but has done something not very many
hairdressers before her have done. She has published research[^ja] in an
academic journal---the [Journal of Roman
Archaeology](http://www.journalofromanarch.com/). Apparently after work she
goes home and tries to recreate the hairdos of the ancient Romans. As she
studied history books and experimented, she couldn't get the hairdos to hold
together. She persisted and finally had a breakthrough. 

So she decided to write about it. "It's amazing how much chutzpah you have when
you have no idea what you're doing," she said. I don't write scholarly
material. I'm a hairdresser." The journal's editor, John Humphrey surmised, "I
could tell even from the first version that it was a very serious piece of
experimental archaeology which no scholar who was not a hairdresser---in other
words, no scholar---would have been able to write."

This highlights, in my opinion, a dichotomy that exists in academia today.

Cross-discipline collaboration is far from commonplace.

It is natural for people of likemindedness to come together. Mathmaticians
enjoy talking with other mathmaticians. It is easy to relate to each other.
Journals have been created because like-minded academicians and researchers
said, "Why don't we create a journal for our field?" However, in this era of
interconnected-ness it is not enough anymore. We can't stop there! We have to
reach beyond our field and connect our research to everything else. There are
thousands of journals out there, but they mostly exist in isolation. Once the
journal is printed and mailed out, they editors feel their job is done. 

There should be no excuse for researchers to continue working in isolation. 

What is so cool to me is that someone down in the trenches---not in the ivory
tower---figured it out. Ms. Stephens is an unusual mix of hairdresser *and*
archaeologist. We need more researchers like that.

This is such a good example of a [bridge builder](/research/#p[OwgWnb],h[OwgWnb,3]) that I wanted to share it.
