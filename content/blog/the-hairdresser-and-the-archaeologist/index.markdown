I don't know much about hairdos, especially those that were in vogue <span
class="oldstyle">1500</span> years ago. But it turns out that the experts may
not have known everything there is to know about them either. Last week, on the
front page of the Wall Street Journal was [a
story](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324900204578286272195339456.html)[^1]
about a very unusual hairdresser named Janet Stephens. 

<!--MORE-->

Ms. Stephens is a hairdresser by trade, but has done something not very many
hairdressers before her have done. She has published research[^ja] in an
academic journal---the [Journal of Roman
Archaeology](http://www.journalofromanarch.com/). Apparently after work she
goes home and tries to recreate the hairdos of the ancient Romans. As she
studied history books and experimented, she couldn't get the hairdos to hold
together. She persisted and finally had a breakthrough. 

The most amazing thing, to me, is that she took the time to publish her
findings. "It's amazing how much chutzpah you have when you have no idea what
you're doing," she said. I don't write scholarly material. I'm a hairdresser."
The journal's editor, John Humphrey surmised, "I could tell even from the first
version that it was a very serious piece of experimental archaeology which no
scholar who was not a hairdresser---in other words, no scholar---would have
been able to write."

This highlights, in my opinion, one of the brightest possibilities for the
future of research and research collaboration.

We should not leave the discovery of knowledge only to the academically elite.
Everyone is an expert in something. In much of the new thought on leadership, 

While practitioners discover new things every day, few take the time (or would
even want to learn _how_) to publish their findings in a scholarly journal. But
many could and *would* participate in the research process, if there were
easier ways to do so.

For many in the academic and research communities, the publication of journal
articles is tied tightly to job continuity and promotion. Yet, scholarly
writing, in many cases, is too byzantine and impenetrable for human
consumption. It is almost as if the writers were more concerned about keeping
the research to themselves rather than freely disseminating it to the
world.[^1st-journals]

Cross-discipline collaboration is far from commonplace.

It is natural for people of likemindedness to come together. Mathmaticians
enjoy talking with other mathmaticians. It is easy to relate to each other.
Journals have been created because like-minded academicians and researchers
said, "Why don't we create a journal for our field?" However, in this era of
interconnected-ness it is not enough anymore. We can't stop there! We have to
reach beyond our field and connect our research to everything else. There are
thousands of journals out there, but they mostly exist in isolation. Once the
journal is printed and mailed out, they editors feel their job is done. 

There should be no excuse for researchers to continue working in isolation. 

The current research publication process worked well when the only way to
publish was in print. We live in a different world now and think that the whole
publication process needs to be redesigned for this new world. While there are
interim solutions, it only makes sense to make the process more granular.

What is so cool to me is that someone down in the trenches---not in the ivory
tower---figured it out. Ms. Stephens is an unusual mix of hairdresser *and*
archaeologist. We need more researchers like that.

This is such a good example of a [bridge builder](/research/#p[OwgWnb],h[OwgWnb,3]) that I wanted to share it.

[^1st-journals]: 
    The original scientific journals, the Philosophical Transactions of the
    Royal Society and the Journal des s√ßavans, were created to provide a means
    of establishing
    [priority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_priority), and not
    necessarily to disseminate research to the public. Many researchers,
    including Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz actually
    enciphered their findings using anagrams so that the uninformed could not
    read them! For more information see
