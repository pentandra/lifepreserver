While there are notable efforts making research publications and data available for free with open access, there is a self-evident disconnect between research documents as far as machines are concerned. This is mostly due to machine-friendly methods for scholarly articles are neither solicited by research institutions or journals, nor exploited by researchers. This is concerning especially when the research knowledge pertaining to <em>Web Science</em> eventually inhabits in the Web ecosystem. Thus, our motivation is to ensure that research documents are as human and machine-friendly as possible.</span></p>

                        <p>Let us take a look at significant efforts which contribute towards meeting the challenge of making research knowledge more accessible to people and societies.</p>

                                <p id="berlin-declaration">The <cite><a href="http://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities</a></cite> is one of the milestones of the OA (<em>Open Access</em>) movement [<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>]. Today, the push for more OA publishing is widely embraced and celebrated by many, including; researchers, governments, universities, libraries, archives, and funding agencies. The OA strategy is intended to address issues on standards, quality, stability, and transition of scholarly research. While there political and social mandates with best practices, there are no explicit technical mandates for systems and technologies (e.g., Web semantics) to carry out the OA mission.</p>

                                <p id="digital-agenda-for-europe">In order <q cite="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/revision-psi-directive">to further open up the market for services based on public-sector information</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-3">3</a>], the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/revision-psi-directive">European Commission PSI Directive</a> ‚Äî a digital agenda for Europe ‚Äî recommends high-demand datasets from libraries and archives be <q cite="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C:2014:240:FULL&amp;from=EN">published in machine-readable and open formats (CSV, JSON, XML, RDF, etc.) to enhance accessibility</q>, and <q cite="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C:2014:240:FULL&amp;from=EN">described in rich metadata formats and classified according to standard vocabularies</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-4">4</a>], and <q>to facilitate re-use, public sector bodies should [...] make documents available [...] at the best level of precision and granularity, in a format that ensures interoperability</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>]. Here again we observe well-intended recommendations without concrete mandates on technology or systems on precisely how research documents should be shared.</p>

                                <p id="open-data-ireland">There are notable initiatives by public sector bodies which take on holistic approaches <q cite="http://per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Best-Practice-Handbook.pdf">to build a sustainable ecosystem around data that supports social, economic and political impact</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-6">6</a>]. The recommendations lean towards making <em>reusable</em> and machine-friendly formats available, in parallel to their PDF equivalents.</p>

                                <p id="practical-knowledge-representation-for-the-web">In 1999 article, <cite><a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/postscript/IJCAI99-III.html">Practical Knowledge Representation for the Web</a></cite> stated that <q>the lack of semantic markup is a major barrier to the development of more intelligent document processing on the Web</q>, and <q>meta-data annotation of Web sources is essential for applying AI techniques on a large and successful scale</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-7">7</a>], which at large, remain as open issues today.</p>

                                <p id="web-science-community">The Web Science community continues to conduct research tracks, workshops, and challenges, in a manner that even the call for papers of top-level Web conferences request research documents that are neither machine nor Web-<em>friendly</em>. There remains strong demands for submissions to be solely in Word or PDF formats, meanwhile requesting strict adherence to the dimensions and limitations of a printable page. Unfortunately, research articles which discuss the discoveries about the Semantic Web, <em>semantic publications</em> or <em>linked science</em> are locked inside well-known data-silos: Word and PDF, and thus unnecessarily challenging to extract information, or conduct pattern recognition from within. The community is however becoming more aware of the public discussions around these issues in recent years, and considering to make efforts towards improving the state of research publishing within its own field.</p>

                                <p id="semantic-web-journal-reviews">For academic reviews, the <cite><a href="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/">Semantic Web Journal</a></cite> adapts an open and transparent review process with publicly available responses on the site <q cite="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/reviewers">Assigned editors and reviewers are known by name, and are published together with accepted manuscript</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-8">8</a>].</p>

                                <p id="web-science-efforts">It should be noted that, there are important achievements in Web Science that contribute to the future of scholarly communication, for example, vocabulary and ontology engineering (e.g., PROV-O, OPMW, Wf4Ever, SPAR, SIO, DDI-RDF, QB), tool-building, conceptual and architectural designs. The application of these discoveries and efforts are however absent in research articles.</p>

                                <p id="publishers-journals">In the publishing and journal space, there are different business models in place: from traditional publishers charging the readers and institutions per article, open-access publishers charging per publishing researcher, to one-time membership fees. While these systems provide varying options for research publications, the commonality is that the research documents are disjoint from one another at the lower data level, e.g., variables, hypothesis (as opposed to basic metadata). By in large, research knowledge is packaged with the intention of being printed on paper. Hence, the requirements of the publishers and journals from (Web) conferences are that, submissions foremost comply with printability. There exists digital journals, which have an open policy for the submission format, but those are few and far between.</p>

Relations between the information on a granular level do not exist, thus increasingly making it difficult to acquire knowledge which would be otherwise better machine and human-accessible.</dd>

We propose a shift in scholarly communication: adoption of <strong>native</strong> Web technologies and standards declaratively from ground up; authoring, publishing and consuming, in order to improve the quality of knowledge representation and acquisition on the Web. Researchers should control and make their knowledge accessible to the greatest extent possible. Our argument is antithetical to knowledge extraction methods from non-machine processable documents, post-publishing semantic uplifting, as well as inadequate user experiences in context of the Web. In our approach, we adopt Web technologies which are designed with the principles to evolve and have information accessible to many.

                                <p>It is important to have a system that adapts <em>user-centred design</em> processes in order to allow users (both content producers and consumers) to intuitively interact with the system. This is so that researchers do not focus on the user interface, but that they are seamlessly engaged in their work. While actual experiences may not be completely designed, they can be supported with <em>affordances</em>.</p>

                                <p>It also follows that, building a ubiquitous user experience across different devices (i.e., customizing the user interface and interactions based on the characteristics of user‚Äôs media device) would be preferable to accommodate different access points, and learning styles.</p>

                        <p>We base our design decisions for maximizing the potential for knowledge acquisition of scholarly articles around these design principles. By design, HTML fulfils the principle of least power. As far as computer languages and their environments go, HTML is the least common denominator; it can be used virtually from any device; from command-line terminals, desktop browsers, smartwatches to cars, whether on or offline. Together with HTTP, the undeniable penetration of HTML, both on a technological and social level makes it a clear winner for information distribution.</p>

                        <p>Using the widely accepted and adapted Web standards, we can use the Web in its truest sense to close the gap between research efforts and people. If each research is semantically described at high-caliber, it will be possible to connect with other research. Thus, the solution must rest in the direction of applying ways to network concepts and ideas as closely as possible, and have them accessible.</p>

                        <p>As research continuously makes way to new ideas, architectures, user experiences, and social changes, it should be possible to access and examine its evolution as knowledge becomes available. This can unleash greater awareness of the changes in research; what are the experiments? what do we not know? what to work on next?</p>

                        <p>Let us consider a way to examine our challenges.</p>

                        <section id="formats" about="[this:#requirements]" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="[this:#formats]">
                            <h3 about="[this:#formats]" property="dcterms:title">Format War</h3>
                            <div about="[this:#formats]" property="dcterms:description">
                                <p>Historically speaking, <em>format wars</em> occur between incompatible formats which compete for the same market e.g., AC versus DC. In that sense, we consider PDF and HTML formats to be competing in a system for knowledge discovery and acquisition. We consider PDF as the predominant format perceived based on historic precedent, and HTML as the challenger with disruptive potential. Let us have a look at some of their characteristics.</p>

                                <p id="tex">Donald E. Knuth, the inventor of TeX, considers it to be a program written using the literate programming approach. LaTeX, which is widely used in scholarly articles is a collection of TeX macros. PDF is usually generated from LaTeX.</p>

                                <p id="pdf">PDF is intended for displaying and storing, and generally self-contained. However, it is not intended to be editable as the formatting instructions are no longer available. PDF is inherently layout oriented, and it is an optimal format for printing. Publishers tend to require a fixed layout with typographical guidelines for research documents, hence research articles in PDF are normally destined and <em>designed</em> for printing.</p>

                                <p id="xmp">In order to facilitate metadata interchange, an XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) package in the form of XML (most commonly serialized as RDF/XML) may be embedded in PDF (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=57421">ISO 16684-1:2012</a>). Otherwise, semantically useful information is not preserved when PDFs are generated, and makes it difficult to go back to source content format.</p>

                                <p id="html">HTML is both a content format for encoding information, and a document format for storing information. HTML is the most used and open international standard (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=27688">ISO 15445:2000</a>). In our discussion, we consider XHTML as part of HTML (barring the differences in the W3C specifications).</p>

                                <p id="html-usage">HTML is easy to reuse, exploit, process, and extend. HTML does not have a hard page limit, so it can reflow to fit different displays. HTML has ubiquitous support across devices.</p>

                                <p id="html-css-pdf">If HTML is used as the original format to record the information, a PDF copy can be generated on demand, using the specifications of the user. With an accompanying CSS for the HTML, desired layout guidelines can be achieved. Converting from PDF to HTML+CSS while possible, the precision rests on rendering the view, as opposed to creating a structurally and semantically meaningful document.</p>

                                <p id="pdf-legacy-format">Offloading fundamental research knowledge via PDF may be preferable or convenient for some, however it comes only at the cost of losing access to granular information. Thus, PDF‚Äôs primary focus; the presentation layer leads to legacy documents that are not reusable in the long run.</p>

                                <p id="elsevier-survey-pdf-vs-html" about="[this:#formats]" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="[this:#elsevier-survey-pdf-vs-html]">In the survey conducted by Elsevier, <cite><a href="http://www.elsevier.com/connect/pdf-versus-html-which-do-researchers-prefer">PDF versus HTML ‚Äî which do researchers prefer?</a></cite> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-14">14</a>], authors report <q>more than 65 percent said they thought there would be a shift towards HTML use in the future.</q></p>

                                <p>In order to preserve and make information more accessible from different devices, the storage format choice should be based on flexibility and evolvability.</p>

                                <p>A fundamental requirement for authors is to be able to create documents which will work on different layers i.e., content/structure, presentation, behaviour. The tooling should pre-emptively enable the <em>progressive enhancement</em> strategy to emphasize on the creation of research documents which are accessible, semantically rich, accommodating different views, and interactive. This is in contrast to singular or binary documents which pre-package all the material predominantly into a single view layer.</p>

                                <p>The modular approach allows different layers to co-exist, be extended and evolve over time. For example, if a research fragment is globally identifiable on the Web and its description is <em>looked up</em>, it can be discussed in a future document with different presentation and behaviours than the original document.</p>

                                    <div about="[this:#structure-semantics-layer]" property="dcterms:description">
                                        <p>The POSH (<em>plain old semantic HTML</em>) approach reinforce the semantics and meaning into web pages such that the content can be more explicitly defined, described, and related to any hypermedia. In order to enable this, authors will require tooling with such features. There are two leading approaches to mark the content, with different design principles behind: <a href="http://microformats.org/"><em>microformats</em></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/"><em>RDFa</em></a>. microformats takes the minimalist approach by focusing on lowering the barrier for entry for authors. In a nutshell, microformats are small patterns of HTML to represent commonly published things in web pages. RDFa on the other hand makes it possible to embed arbitrary statements using any vocabulary or ontology in HTML. It extends HTML with additional attributes in order to apply the RDF data model. RDFa is one of the ways to notate the RDF language such that the atomic components of a statement can be declared, e.g., <code>(A, made, B)</code>, discovered and reused on the Web.</p>

                                        <p id="why-rdfa">The application of the RDF language is the fundamental choice, and it can be notated in different ways. While transformations between different RDF notations are trivial, our decision to use RDFa in HTML over alternative approaches; Turtle and JSON-LD, is as follows. RDFa can be purposed towards the human-visible (or accessible) portions of the document, and are typically marked inline and in context of where the ideas occur in the document. It is to treat the information available as first-class data as opposed to metadata (which may be hidden from view). While Turtle and JSON-LD may also be written inline, they tend to act as raw data islands, and are slightly disconnected from the context that is human-readable in an HTML document. Concerning data quality, information marked with RDFa is less likely to rot or go stale because of its visibility (or accessibility) to humans, and due to authoring from their canonical location. Knowing and applying RDFa is a matter of extending HTML (via attributes). Therefore, RDFa is perceivably a simple entry to add semantics to documents ‚Äî in contrast to learning different notations, which are quite distinct from HTML; Turtle and JSON-LD. It should however be noted that Turtle and JSON-LD can be well-purposed in the case of interactive documents. While our justification is aimed at using RDFa for semantic representations, we focus on a user interface that allows the author to work at the level of the RDF language, as opposed to on the syntax level.</p>

                                        <p id="rdface">In this space, one well researched authoring tool which combines WYSIWYG and WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) text authoring with the creation of rich semantic annotations is the <cite><a href="http://rdface.aksw.org/">RDFaCE</a></cite> (RDFa Content Editor) [<a class="ref" href="#ref-19">19</a>]. Authors can use both bottom-up and top-down approaches to create semantic content using different views. The user interface provides a way to enrich the content using external services.</p>

                                <p>Citations in scholarly articles play an important role as they make a statement, which associates one document or its fragment with what is referred. As citations are vital to creating awareness, interlinking, dissemination, exploring and evaluating research, the mechanism to accomplish that should take into account at fine granularity. It follows that, citations are not merely connections at the document level, but can serve to refer to individual research fragments, from concepts, hypothesis, workflow steps, claims, evidence, arguments, to any annotation declared in other research articles.</p>

                                <p id="hypothesizing-impact-factor">We hypothesize that the reusable bits of information that are publicly accessible will naturally give birth to quality metrics which can be directly measured towards the research impact factor. This is akin to the Web economics to hyperlinking documents, where the quality and quantity of backlinks tend to indicate the importance of the cited work. Linking is the nuts and bolts of information for centuries, and it holds true for information shared on the Web.</p>

                                <p>A feedback system where individual responses to the research article can be referenced and archived is pivotal to strengthening the body of knowledge, its interpretation, and the questions it raises. In order to foster diverse readers, the functionality should welcome academic reviews, as well as comments and annotations by anyone in the spirit of <em>open science</em>, and machine-generated responses. Depending on the context, it may be appropriate to integrate a consensus system (e.g., up or down) to encourage well-written or approved responses to be more visible democratically. With the adoption of <em>attributed peer review</em>s, responses can be rigorous and objective as they can be, while retaining transparency and identity of the reviewers, e.g., using decentralized authentication. This additionally creates an opportunity for the research community to carry out an open dialogue which will then retain substantial knowledge for the future simply by micro-contributions. Thus, efforts should be made to capture information from the readers in a machine-friendly way to allow data-mining operations. Being able to refer to responses would also mean that, a response in one document may refer to a response in another document, irrespective of their location on the Web.</p>

                                <p>While complete reproducibility may not be possible, efforts should be taken to indicate or demonstrate the essential components of the experiments. Where applicable, this can be anywhere from allowing a (human or machine) consumer to discover the resources that are integral for reproduction, to creating an executable paper environment where; some code can be rerun, observing the effects of changing parameters, allowing sample data uploads, or other explorations which could be conducted inside lightweight and portable VM environments.</p>

                                <p>If the community shifts its focus towards soundness, and completeness (where possible) in papers, the underlying elements that make up the workflows can have automated tests and verifications.

                                <p>Demonstrating reproducibility inside research articles also helps the reader to experiment and learn in context of the material.

                        <p>In this article, we have discussed a way to improve the state of publishing and consuming scholarly articles. That is, by way of employing the true Web stack, we are able to achieve what is desirable for human and machine consumption, meanwhile supporting the current scholarly publishing methods. Let us take a look further:</p>

                        <p id="web-science-community-behaviour">What constitutes a scholarly article? While the jury may be out on their verdict, we have a few observations which may lead us to understand one aspect of the situation we are in. As the publishers are the main dependency in which the guidelines (i.e., printability) are set forth, then it follows that the researchers (and their institutions) are merely following them in order to fulfil their organisational requirements. Researcher adopt non-machine friendly practices and requirements for papers as instructed, regardless of their technical abilities to better share their knowledge with the rest of humanity. <span id="social-not-technical">Therefore, the underlying issue to note here is due to social reasons, as opposed to technical.</span> If for instance, steering committees, conferences or journals mandate researchers to adopt human and machine-friendly methods for their research articles i.e., using the native Web technologies and standards, we could observe a far richer research ecosystem than what we are used to.</p>

                        <p id="researchers-taking-initiative">Regardless of how the Web Science landscape evolves, there is one thing that each researcher can do now: taking initiative to have complete control of their own publications as discussed in Linked Research. This entails that researchers first share their knowledge with the rest of the Web that can be consumed by humans and machines. Second, researchers submit a copy of that work to relevant institutions using their submission requirements, in order to comply with organisational needs. If and when the existing publication workflow evolves, the second step will naturally dissolve.</p>

                        <p>We contemplate two key open challenges:</p>

                        <p id="adoption" about="[this:]" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="[this:#adoption]"><span about="[this:#adoption]" typeof="deo:FutureWork" property="dcterms:description"><em>Adoption</em> is an open issue. Needless to say, forcing to change the people‚Äôs way of working is not the most fruitful endeavour. Future work will need to focus on helping the researchers (at the grass-roots level) to publish their own research within a workflow that‚Äôs suitable to them. This may be by supporting simple POSH authoring tools, or extensions and plugins for existing content management systems. This is fundamentally about documenting the new set of use cases, and implementing them, preferably without software installations or creating accounts on third-party systems.</span></p>

                        <p id="identity" about="[this:]" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="[this:#identity]"><span about="[this:#identity]" typeof="deo:FutureWork" property="dcterms:description"><em>Identity</em> is another open issue. As identity is usually at the centre of everything, there remains a challenge to adopt decentralized authentication methods. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/">WebID</a> is one promising approach ‚Äî as it ties well with the Web and Linked Data stack ‚Äî provided that the user experience for the generation of certificates, and their accessibility across devices is improved. In parallel, having systems recognize and use WebID, needs to be widely accepted in order for researchers to 1) assign themselves a Web identity, and 2) collaborate with other researchers.</span></p>

A special thanks to <a about="[this:]" rel="cito:isReviewedBy" resource="http://www.jodischneider.com/#me" href="http://jodischneider.com/jodi.html">Jodi Schneider</a><span about="http://csarven.ca/#i" rel="foaf:knows" resource="http://www.jodischneider.com/#me"></span> for their early review of this article. Our topic of discussion, research and development efforts are a result of our inspiration of the values that are inherent to the World Wide Web, as well as Tim Berners-Lee‚Äôs design principles. Our goals are influenced by James Burke‚Äôs explanation of our world as it gets increasingly interconnected.</p>
