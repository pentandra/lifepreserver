      We see research simply as the process of learning and the creation of
      knowledge. Learning is a fundamental need of humanity. The sharing of
      knowledge is the essence of education. We think that open, collaborative,
      and living research projects will form the foundation of education in the
      future.

  <h2>What is Research?</h2>

  <div class="bd">
    <p>

      <span class="newthought">Research is a journey of discovery.</span> It is
      a process---the ultimate goal of which is to understand ourselves and the
      world around us. By nature, we are inquisitive. We want to know how
      things work. We have questions that beg for answers. Whenever we look for
      answers we are doing research, though we may not think of it as such.  In
      a sense, <em>each of us</em> who has sought answers to life's difficult
      questions is a researcher!

      Yet '<q>never before has science [and research] become so alienated from
        the common man, and he, in turn, so suspicious of science</q>,' said
      Erwin Chargaff, the biochemist. It doesn't have to be this way. Research
      must be <a title="Designing for Open Access > Democratizing Research"
        href="/blog/designing-for-open-access/#sec:democratizing-research">brought
        back down to its roots</a>, the avocation of the inspired and
      impassioned.

          It is the sense of mystery that, in my opinion, drives the true
          scientist; the same force, blindly seeing, deafly hearing,
          unconsciously remembering, that drives the larva into the butterfly.
          If he has not experienced, at least a few times in his life, this
          cold shudder down his spine, this confrontation with an immense,
          invisible face whose breath moves him to tears, he is not a
          scientist.

  <h2>The Research Process</h2>

  <div class="bd">
    <p>

      Research is a process---it's <em>not</em> the papers or other outputs
      that are published at the end of that process. We see the research
      process as being made of little building blocks that are put together in
      various ways as research progresses. One of our goals is to make the
      research process---the journey of discovery---shareable. It's our
      passion.

    <h2>The Future of Research: A Manifesto</h2>

          In <span class="oldstyle">1945</span>, the director of the US Office

              Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the

          This situation has not changed a whole lot since then. Yes, we have
          computers and digital documents now, but we are still stuck in the
          same publishing paradigm. It can still take one or two <em>years</em>
          to get a research paper published! And then, we only publish our
          research conclusions. While conclusions are important, research is
          more than conclusions. Conclusions are only a small part of the
          story. Most of our research process is not being published and ends
          up lost. 

        </p>
        <p>

          Why is our sharing process still so limited? Why do we limit
          scholarly publication to catatonic research papers, when sharing the
          entire journey of discovery would be more beneficial for everyone?
          Research is a rich experience that should be shareable. 

        </p>

          Traditionally, universities and other large research organizations
          have contributed the vast majority of research to the world. While
          these organizations may continue to play a large role, we believe
          that practitioners and <a
            title="Designing for Open Access > Democratizing Research"
            href="/blog/designing-for-open-access/#sec:democratizing-research">amateurs</a>
          will lead the way in the research of the future. In addition, modern
          research and e-research systems will lower the entry barrier for
          quality research contributions, making it possible for more people to
          contribute to high-quality research projects.

          While the research process across disciplines may seem very similar
          on the surface, differences in research communities, knowledge
          representations, and vocabularies arise under closer scrutiny. To be
          most effective, research software needs to be designed specifically
          for the field it is trying to support. However, we think that <a
            href="#sec:clarity">clarity</a>, <a
            href="#sec:context">context</a>, and <a
            href="#sec:collaboration">collaboration</a> are three elements that
          should be present in any modern research system.

            Like tesserae in a mosaic, the building blocks of research should
            be visible and connected so others can understand how you put the
            pieces together.

        Research should be clear and transparent. Every piece of information
        that contributed to the conclusion should be accessible. Research must
        clearly show not only <em>what</em> data was used, but <em>how</em> the
        data was used to answer the question.  Otherwise, subsequent
        researchers will not know how the pieces were put together. 

      </p>
      <p>

        Clarity is important not only so that others can understand and
        verify your research conclusions, but because you don't want to leave
        out your journey of discovery. This is the crux of research. Why are
        we leaving out the good stuff?

        Our world grows increasingly compartmentalized. We pursue our
        specialization as if with blinders, trying to push forward progress in
        our chosen field. Modern researchers and research systems need to take
        a more holistic approach.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" rel="external">Systems thinkers</a>
        need to show how research in one field relates to research in another.
        We need bridge builders that can see the big picture and make
        connections between bodies of knowledge, subjects, and individual
        lives.

        Research is only correctly understood in its proper context. When that
        fuller context is considered, new avenues for research are opened and
        barriers are breached. Holes in the research, if any, are also
        revealed.

        Modern research and research systems are collaborative. The rewards of

        There is still so much to learn about ourselves and our world. Because

        there is no danger of running out of work to do. However, we will move
