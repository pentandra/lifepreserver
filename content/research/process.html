      So, how do you learn how to research? In order to answer that question
      we need to take a closer look at the research <em>process</em>.
      Research is messy. To an outside observer, research may even look a bit
      like chaos theory. Even so, a good researcher is fully aware of the
      research process and knows exactly what is going on and why.

        One of our favorite definitions of research was made by John Creswell
        from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln:

        You see, research is just trying to better understand the world around
        us. It's nothing to be afraid of. However, as every seasoned researcher
        knows, it helps to have a framework that can help guide you as you work
        your way toward a conclusion. For every question asked, there are a
        thousand ways to proceed. You need to be familiar with the steps of the
        research process so you can stay on track and <em>really know</em> when
        you have arrived at a solid conclusion.

        Let's take a journey through the research process. First, we'll take 
        a drive through the <a href="#io">inputs and outputs</a>.
        Then, we'll stop by the <a href="#phases">phases</a> of the research
        process. After that, we'll define <a href="#unit">the fundamental unit</a> 
        of research. And finally we'll visit the <a href="#proof">pillars of proof</a>.
        While the research process can vary a lot depending on the field of
        research, this journey should at least give you a good intro to the
        fundamentals.

      </p>
      <p>

        Before we can start our journey, however, we need a question.
        Questions are always the beginning of the research process.
        Conclusions are the end. Only after we have a question can we try to
        find an answer! All of the good stuff---the journey of discovery---is
        sandwiched in-between. So grab a question and let's go!

      <h3>Inputs and Outputs: The "What's" of Research</h3>

      <p>

        The easiest things to grasp when talking about the research process are
        the tangible things---the things that we can see, touch, read and
        write. For example, the research process starts with a <span class="oldstyle">question</span>.
        A question is something concrete---something we can write down. As we
        complete any step (or <a href="#phases">phase</a>) of the research
        process we are left with one or more of these tangibles, which we call
        <em>research outputs</em>.

      </p>
      <p>
        
        In research, everything is connected. One thing flows into another. As
        <a class="oldstyle" href="#fig:io">figure 2</a> shows, outputs from one
        phase are used as the inputs for the next phase. In other words, inputs
        are dependent upon the outputs of previous phases of the research
        process.

      </p>
      <p>

        So what are these outputs and inputs? Between the question and
        conclusion, the three other parts form the skeletal scaffolding of the
        research process:

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Data</dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Data is raw, uninterpreted stuff. Given a field of research, data
            is the source from which researchers in that field gather
            information.

          </p>
          <p>

            Data could include measurements made during experiments for a
            physicist or historical documents for a genealogist or historian.
            Data can even include research papers that are studied during the
            course of research. 

          </p>

        </dd>

        <dt>Information</dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Information is interpreted data---interpreted as knowledge of the
            research domain. Information should be understood by someone that is
            familiar with the research domain.

          </p>

        </dd>

        <dt>Evidence</dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Evidence is interpreted information---interpreted in the context of
            the question. Evidence shows how the information answers the
            research question.

          </p>

        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>

        While these inputs and outputs seem very simple at first glance, the
        actual research process does not usually follow a predetermined path.
        Gathering and analyzing data often lead us into seemingly random paths
        as we try to build a conclusion. Yet at the end, we should be able to
        look back and see where the evidence comes from.

      <h3>Phases: The "How's" of Research</h3>

      <p>

        Now that you know about the inputs and outputs of research, how do we
        move from one step to the next? There is a transition between each
        step of the research process where we take a research
        <span class="special">output</span> and use it as an
        <span class="special">input</span> for the next step, applying it in a
        new way. Each of these transitions between an output and an input is
        called a <dfn id="phase">phase</dfn> of the research process.

      </p>
      <p>

        While we tend to lump all these phases together and call it "research,"
        each of these four phases has a very specific purpose and approach:

      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>Orientation</dt>
        <dd>

          During this phase the question "sinks in" and becomes structured for
          the researcher.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
          The situation is assessed and the researcher becomes oriented to the
          possibilities.

        </dd>

        <dt>Exploration</dt>
        <dd>

          During this phase the researcher tries out some of the possibilities
          to see where they will lead. A good explorer will keep an open mind
          to make sure nothing is missed before proceeding.
        
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Investigation</dt>
        <dd>

          This is the stage to pursue the most promising possibilities further.
          Deeper digging is required to choose the best possibility.
          
        </dd>

        <dt>Proof</dt>
        <dd>

          During this final stage we can confirm or prove that the choice is
          right. Tests are performed to make sure that the conclusion fits with
          everything else that is known.
          
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>

        Of course, research does not normally progress linearly through these
        stages from <span class="special">orientation</span> down to
        <span class="special">proof</span>. It is an iterative process. Often,
        research follows a seemingly random and cyclical pattern. However,
        progress through these phases can sometimes happen so fast that we
        don't realize it. Other times it takes longer. It depends on the
        problem at hand. This process continues until answers are found and
        questions are laid to rest.

      </p>
      <p>

        If a mistake is made in an early phase, everything built later upon
        those outputs will be based on wrong assumptions. Remember the old
        quip: "garbage in, garbage out."

      </p>
      <p>

        <span class="newthought">Outputs form the future possibilities</span>
        that pull us onward through the maze of research. As we work toward a
        conclusion, we select some outputs to use as inputs for the next phase
        and continue until we can finally answer the question. Often, when we
        start arranging evidence we hit a dead end or find that we don't have
        enough to build a solid conclusion. Then it becomes necessary to
        revisit earlier phases and do more digging. However, with each phase
        and iteration, the <span class="special">conclusion</span> becomes a
        little more sure.

        Research is a lot like chess. Strategy is required to assemble the bits
        of evidence the right way. However, one difference is that chess has a
        very finite number of possibilities, while research is more dynamic
        with almost limitless possibilities. With research, you discover the
        rules and the playing pieces as you go along. But, like chess, your
        eventual placement in the game is the sum of all the previous moves you
        have made on the game board.

      </p>
      <p>
        
        We, as researchers, ultimately choose the course to follow. Choice is
        the fundamental navigator of the research process. Choose carefully.

      <h3>A Unit of Research</h3>

      <p>

        So this framework idea sounds nice, but how do we keep track of it all?
        Large research problems can be overwhelming. If we break up these large
        problems into bite-sized pieces, research becomes more straightforward.
        Like scientists that break matter down into atoms, we need to isolate a
        unit of research so that research can be more manageable.

      </p>
      <p>

        No doubt about it, research is hard. But too much time and effort can
        be spent in bookkeeping, and not in putting the pieces together. If we
        can reduce the time spent on bookkeeping, we will have more time to
        think about how to put the pieces together. 

      </p>
      <p>

        We have taken apart the research process to figure out how to make the
        process easier for researchers. What we found is that while computers
        are not very good at <em>doing</em> research, they are really good at
        <em>organizing</em> research. Computers can take care of the
        bookkeeping so that researchers have more time to put the pieces
        together.

          So how can we break up research into smaller pieces? The answer is
          obvious---in our minds we already group little bundles of research
          together almost instinctively. In fact, we've discussed it already!
          There is a natural demarcation between these little bundles of
          research, bounded by a <span class="special">question</span> and a
          <span class="special">conclusion</span>. We call these little bundles
          of research <em class="special">cases</em>.

        So after we have done some research, how do we know how good it is?
        Just as we need to break down a large research problem into cases, we
        need to be able to look backwards and evaluate our research. An inward
        perspective is needed for this. We can know how well our research
        "measures up" by looking back and comparing what we have done to a
        standard. The standard varies depending on the domain, but generally
        includes the following checkpoints:

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Attributed</dt>
        <dd>
          Don't be a weasel. Give credit where credit is due.

        Luckily, cases come in handy here as well. If each case in our project

        We need to periodically look back and evaluate our progress, making
        sure that we have not strayed from the path and that we have not left
        any stone unturned. Peer review gives us a second opinion as others
        look back on our research to assess its quality.

        All research conclusions involve opinion. It is up to you, as a
        researcher, to prove that your opinion is right.

            How can you prove that your conclusions are right? The strength of
            your proof can be measured with the help of five checkpoints.
