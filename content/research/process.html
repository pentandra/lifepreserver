      So, how do you learn how to research? In order to answer that question
      we need to take a closer look at the research <em>process</em>.
      Research is messy. To an outside observer, research may even look a bit
      like chaos theory. Even so, a good researcher is fully aware of the
      research process and knows exactly what is going on and why.

    </p>

    <nav>
      <p>

        Let's take a journey through the research process. First, we'll take 
        a drive through the <a href="#io">inputs and outputs</a>.
        Then, we'll stop by the <a href="#phases">phases</a> of the research
        process. After that, we'll define <a href="#unit">the fundamental unit</a> 
        of research. And finally we'll visit the <a href="#proof">pillars of proof</a>.
        While the research process can vary a lot depending on the field of
        research, this journey should at least give you a good intro to the
        fundamentals.

      </p>
      <p>

        Before we can start our journey, however, we need a question.
        Questions are always the beginning of the research process.
        Conclusions are the end. All of the good stuff---the journey of
        discovery---is sandwiched in-between. Only after we have a question
        can we try to find an answer!
        
      </p>
      <p>

        Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go!

    <h3>Inputs and Outputs: The "What's" of Research</h3>

    <p>

      The easiest things to grasp when talking about the research process are
      the tangible things--the things that we can see, touch, read and write.
      After completing a phase of the research process we are left with
      these tangibles, which we call research <em>outputs</em>.

    </p>
    <p>
      
      In research, everything is connected. One thing flows into another. As
      <a href="#fig:outputs">Figure 2</a> shows, an output from one phase can
      be recycled as the input for another. Inputs are dependent upon the
      outputs of previous phases of the research process. They do not follow
      a predetermined path.

    </p>

    <p>

      Between the question and conclusion, the three other parts form the
      skeletal scaffolding of the research process:

    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Data</dt>
      <dd>

        <p>

          Data is raw, uninterpreted stuff. Given a field of research, data
          is the source from which researchers in that field gather
          information.

        </p>
        
        <p>

          Could include measurements made during experiments by a physicist
          or historical documents for a genealogist or historian. This can
          even include research papers that are studied during the course of
          research. 

        </p>

      </dd>

      <dt>Information</dt>
      <dd>

        <p>

          Information is interpreted data---interpreted as knowledge of the
          research domain. It should be understood by someone that is
          familiar with the research domain.

        </p>

      </dd>

      <dt>Evidence</dt>
      <dd>

        <p>

          Evidence is interpreted information---interpreted in the context of
          the question. How does this information answer the question?

        </p>

      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>

      <span class="newthought">Outputs beckon to us,</span> prodding us
      onward, wanting to be selected for the next phase of the research
      process. Inputs point the way to go like a guide points the way through
      an overgrown forest.

          "I don't much care where--" said Alice.<br>
          "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.<br>
          "--so long as I get SOMEWHERE," Alice added as an explanation.<br>
          "Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long
          enough."

      We, as researchers, ultimately choose the course to follow. Choice is
      the fundamental navigator of the research process. Choose carefully.

    <h3>Phases: The "How's" of Research</h3>

    <p>

      Research is a lot like chess. Strategy is required to assemble the bits
      of information the right way. 
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        
        <b>Orientation</b>--assessing the situation and orienting to the possibilities

      </li>
      <li><b>Exploration</b>--Trying out some of the possibilities</li>
      <li><b>Investigation</b>--Digging deeper and choosing the best possibility</li>
      <li><b>Proof</b>--Confirming that the choice is right</li>
      
    </ol>

    <p>

      Oftentimes, we can cycle through these phases in a matter of seconds.
      Sometimes it takes longer. It depends on the problem at hand.

    </p>
    <p>

      While chess has a very finite number of possibilities, research is
      dynamic with almost limitless possibilities. Unlike chess, you discover
      the rules and the playing pieces as you go along. However, just like
      chess, your eventual placement in the game is the sum of all the
      previous moves you have made on the game board.

    </p>

    <p>

      These inputs and outputs point the way in research like a compass
      points the way through an overgrown forest.

    <h3>A Unit of Research</h3>

    <p>

      Like scientists that break matter down into atoms, we need to isolate a
      unit of research so that research can be more manageable.

    </p>
    <p>

      To make these in's and out's more manageable we need a few more tools.
      Large research problems can be overwhelming. If we break up these large
      problems into bite-sized pieces, research becomes more straightforward.
      Likewise, as we look backwards and evaluate our own research, we need a
      measuring stick to measure the quality of what we have accomplished.

      </div>
    </aside>

    <p>

      In our software systems we call this whole thing a <em>case</em>. A
      case is made of a question, its conclusion (if one has been reached),
      and all of the research and analysis undertaken to answer that
      question. Think of it as a little bundle of research.

      The idea of case study research is common in social, educational, and
      political research. Dr. Gary Thomas of the University of Birmingham has
      described case studies as follows:

    </p>

    <figure class="bq grab">
      <blockquote cite="http://qix.sagepub.com/content/17/6/511">
        <p>

          Case studies are analyses of persons, events, decisions, periods,
          projects, policies, institutions, or other systems that are studied
          holistically by one or more methods.
          
        </p>

        <p>Cases can build on top of each other</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>

      Cases are the building blocks of research. Once a case has been built,
      other cases can be built on top of it. Cases can be grouped into
      projects. Cases can be shared with others, allowing others to see not
      only the conclusions, but the entire research process.

    </p>

    <p>

      The research process is not always linear, but oftentimes follows a
      seemingly random and cyclical pattern. One question often leads to more
      questions. This process continues until answers are found and questions
      are laid to rest.

          The outcome of any serious research can only be to make two
          questions grow where only one grew before.

    <h3>The Five Pillars of Proof</h3>
    
    <p>

      So after we have done some research, how do we know how good it is? We
      know by looking back and comparing what we have done to a standard. The
      standard varies depending on the domain, but generally includes the
      following checkpoints:

    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Attribution</dt>
      <dd>
        Don't be a weasel. Did I give credit where credit is due?
      </dd>
      <dt>Comprehensive</dt>
      <dd>
        Research should be thorough. Did I cover all my bases? 
      </dd>
      <dt>Well-Reasoned</dt>
      <dd>
        Think about it. Does the conclusion make sense logically?
      </dd>
      <dt>Verifiable</dt>
      <dd>
        Can someone else retrace my steps? Will they end up at the same place
        I did?
      </dd>
      <dt>Transparent</dt>
      <dd>
        Don't hide your light under a bushel. Explain what you mean so that
        someone else can understand it.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      
      An inward perspective is also needed in research. We look back and
      evaluate our progress, making sure that we have not strayed from the
      path and that we have not left any stone unturned. Peer review gives us
      a second opinion as others look back on our research to assess its
      quality.

    </p>

    <p>

      All research conclusions involve opinion. It is up to you, as a
      researcher, to prove that your opinion is right.
