      So, how do you learn how to research? In order to answer that question
      we need to take a closer look at the research <em>process</em>.
      Research is messy. To an outside observer, research may even look a bit
      like chaos theory. Even so, a good researcher is fully aware of the
      research process and knows exactly what is going on and why.

        One of our favorite definitions of research was made by John Creswell
        from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln:

        You see, research is just trying to better understand the world around
        us. It's nothing to be afraid of. However, as every seasoned researcher
        knows, it helps to have a framework that can help guide you as you work
        your way toward a conclusion. For every question asked, there are a
        thousand ways to proceed. You need to be familiar with the steps of the
        research process so you can stay on track and <em>really know</em> when
        you have arrived at a solid conclusion.

          Let's take a journey through the research process. First, we'll take
          a drive through the <a href="#io">inputs and outputs</a>. Second,
          we'll stop by the <a href="#phases">phases</a> of the research
          process.  After that we'll see how inputs, outputs, and phases work
          together to form a <a href="#framework">research framework</a> that
          can keep us on track throughout our journey. Then, we'll define the
          <a href="#sec:unit-of-research">fundamental unit</a> of research. And
          finally we'll look back on how far we've come while we visit the <a
            href="#pillars-of-proof">pillars of proof</a>. Although the
          research process can vary a lot depending on the field of research,
          this journey should at least give you a good intro to the
          fundamentals.

        <p>

          Before we can start our journey, however, we need a question.
          Questions are always the beginning of the research process.
          Conclusions are the end. Only after we have a question can we try to
          find an answer! All of the good stuff---the journey of discovery---is
          sandwiched in-between. So grab a question and let's go!
          
        </p>
      <p>

        The easiest things to grasp when talking about the research process are
        the tangible things---the things that we can see, touch, read and
        write. For example, the research process starts with a <span class="oldstyle">question</span>.
        A <dfn id="question">question</dfn> is something concrete that we want
        to know---something we can write down. As we complete any step (or 
        <a href="#phases">phase</a>) of the research process we are left with 
        one or more of these tangibles, which we call
        <em>research outputs</em>.

      </p>
      <p>
        
        In research, everything is connected. One thing flows into another. As
        <a href="#fig:io">figure <span class="oldstyle">1</span></a> shows,
        outputs from one phase are used as the inputs for the next phase. In
        other words, inputs are dependent upon the outputs of previous phases
        of the research process.

      </p>
      <p>

        So what are these outputs and inputs? Between the question and
        conclusion, the three other parts form the skeletal scaffolding of the
        research process:

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn id="dfn:data">Data</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Data is raw, uninterpreted stuff. Given a field of research, data
            is the source from which researchers in that field gather
            information.

          </p>
          <p>

            Data could include measurements made during experiments for a
            physicist or historical documents for a genealogist or historian.
            Data can even include research papers that are studied during the
            course of research. 

          </p>

        </dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn:information">Information</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Information is interpreted data---interpreted as knowledge of the
            research domain. Information should be understood by someone that is
            familiar with the research domain.

          </p>

        </dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn:evidence">Evidence</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          <p>

            Evidence is interpreted information---interpreted in the context of
            the question. Evidence shows how the information answers the
            research question.

          </p>

        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>

        While these inputs and outputs seem very simple at first glance, the
        actual research process does not usually follow a predetermined path.
        Gathering and analyzing data often lead us into seemingly random paths
        as we try to build a conclusion. Yet at the end, we should be able to
        look back and see where the evidence comes from.

        <p class="big">The "How's" of Research</p>
      </header>

      <p>

        Now that you know about the inputs and outputs of research, how do we
        move from one step to the next? There is a transition between each
        step of the research process where we take a research
        <span class="special">output</span> and use it as an
        <span class="special">input</span> for the next step, applying it in a
        new way. Each of these transitions between an output and an input is
        called a <dfn id="phase">phase</dfn> of the research process.

      </p>
      <p>

        While we tend to lump all these phases together and call it "research,"
        each of these four phases has a very specific purpose and approach:

      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn id="dfn:orientation">Orientation</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          During this phase the question "sinks in" and becomes structured for
          the researcher.<sup id="fnref:thought-and-choice-in-chess"><a href="#fn:thought-and-choice-in-chess" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
          The situation is assessed and the researcher becomes oriented to the
          possibilities.

        </dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn:exploration">Exploration</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          During this phase the researcher tries out some of the possibilities
          to see where they will lead. A good explorer will keep an open mind
          to make sure nothing is missed before proceeding.
        
        </dd>
        
        <dt><dfn id="dfn:investigation">Investigation</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          This is the stage to pursue the most promising possibilities further.
          Deeper digging is required to choose the best possibility.
          
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn:proof">Proof</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

          During this final stage we can confirm or prove that the choice is
          right. Tests are performed to make sure that the conclusion fits with
          everything else that is known.
          
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>

        Of course, research does not normally progress linearly through these
        stages from <span class="special">orientation</span> down to
        <span class="special">proof</span>. It is an iterative process. Often,
        research follows a seemingly random and cyclical pattern. However,
        progress through these phases can sometimes happen so fast that we
        don't realize it. Other times it takes longer. It depends on the
        problem at hand. This process continues until answers are found and
        questions are laid to rest.

      </p>
      <p>

        If a mistake is made in an early phase, everything built later upon
        those outputs will be based on wrong assumptions. Remember the old
        quip: "garbage in, garbage out."

      </p>
      <p>

        <span class="newthought">Outputs form the future possibilities</span>
        that pull us onward through the maze of research. As we work toward a
        conclusion, we select some outputs to use as inputs for the next phase
        and continue until we can finally answer the question. Often, when we
        start arranging evidence we hit a dead end or find that we don't have
        enough to build a solid conclusion. Then it becomes necessary to
        revisit earlier phases and do more digging. However, as 
        <a href="#fig:phases">figure <span class="oldstyle">2</span></a> shows,
        with each phase and iteration, the 
        <span class="special">conclusion</span> becomes a little more sure.

        Research is a lot like chess. Strategy is required to assemble the bits
        of evidence the right way. However, one difference is that chess has a
        very finite number of possibilities, while research is more dynamic
        with almost limitless possibilities. With research, you discover the
        rules and the playing pieces as you go along. But, like chess, your
        eventual placement in the game is the sum of all the previous moves you
        have made on the game board.

      </p>
      <p>
        
        We, as researchers, ultimately choose the course to follow. Choice is
        the fundamental navigator of the research process. Choose carefully.

        <p>

          So this framework idea sounds nice, but how do we keep track of it
          all?  Large research problems can be overwhelming. If we break up
          these large problems into bite-sized pieces, research becomes more
          straightforward.  Like scientists that break matter down into atoms,
          we need to isolate a unit of research so that research can be more
          manageable.

        </p>
        <p>

          No doubt about it, research is hard. But too much time and effort can
          be spent in bookkeeping, and not in putting the pieces together. If
          we can reduce the time spent on bookkeeping, we will have more time
          to think about how to put the pieces together. 

        </p>
        <p>

          We have taken apart the research process to figure out how to make
          the process easier for researchers. What we found is that while
          computers are not very good at <em>doing</em> research, they are
          really good at <em>organizing</em> research. Computers can take care
          of the bookkeeping so that researchers have more time to put the
          pieces together.

          So how can we break up research into smaller pieces? The answer is
          obvious---in our minds we already group little bundles of research
          together almost instinctively. In fact, we've discussed it already!
          There is a natural demarcation between these little bundles of
          research, bounded by a <span class="special">question</span> and a
          <span class="special">conclusion</span>. We call these little bundles
          <em class="special">research cases</em>.

          There are many ways the word <em>case</em> is used, from legal
          proceedings to enterprise resource planning systems. Researchers
          talk about "building a case." A branch of research, called

          has even been built around this idea. Case study research is common
          in social, educational, and political research. Dr. Gary Thomas of
          the University of Birmingham has described case studies as follows:

              Case studies are analyses of persons, events, decisions, periods,
              projects, policies, institutions, or other systems that are
              studied holistically by one or more methods.

          While our notion of a research case derives from many of these
          wonderful ideas, our definition specifically refers to a software
          structure that could be thought of as a bundle or chunk of research,
          and has applicability in many diverse domains.

      <p>

        So after we have done some research, how do we know how good it is?
        Just as we need to break down a large research problem into research
        cases, we need to be able to look backwards and evaluate our research.
        An inward perspective is needed for this. We can know how well our
        research "measures up" by looking back and comparing what we have done
        to a standard. The standard varies depending on the domain, but
        generally includes the following checkpoints:

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Attributed</dt>
        <dd>
          Don't be a weasel. Give credit where credit is due.
        </dd>
        <dt>Comprehensive</dt>
        <dd>
          Research should be thorough. Did I cover all my bases? 
        </dd>
        <dt>Well-Reasoned</dt>
        <dd>
          Think about it. Does the conclusion make sense logically?
        </dd>
        <dt>Verifiable</dt>
        <dd>
          Can someone else retrace my steps? Will they end up at the same place
          I did?
        </dd>
        <dt>Transparent</dt>
        <dd>
          Don't hide your light under a bushel. Explain what you mean so that
          someone else can understand it.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        
        Luckily, research cases come in handy here as well. If each research
        case in our project measures up, we know that the whole project
        measures up too.

      </p>
      <p>

        We need to periodically look back and evaluate our progress, making
        sure that we have not strayed from the path and that we have not left
        any stone unturned. Peer review gives us a second opinion as others
        look back on our research to assess its quality.

      </p>

      <p>

        All research conclusions involve opinion. It is up to you, as a
        researcher, to prove that your opinion is right.

            How can you prove that your conclusions are right? The strength of
            your proof can be measured with the help of five checkpoints.
