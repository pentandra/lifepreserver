         We're a couple of diehard genealogy junkies. When we were first
         getting into genealogy, we wanted some sort of software to help us
         with our research. While we found many great applications for creating
         family trees, we were looking for something more. We wanted something
         that amplified our research efforts---something that really understood
         the research process. We were tired of curating mythological family
         trees. We wanted something that felt more real. So we wrote down
         everything that we hoped for in a family history research application
         and brainstormed how we could build it. What we came up with was a
         different kind of animal: <strong>Geungle</strong>.

        Geungle is a platform for scholarly genealogical research, sometimes
        referred to as <a href="#gh">generational history</a>. Its core is
        based on the genealogical research process. Its goal is to help do and
        share quality, transparent research that measures up to the
        <a rel="external" href="http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html">genealogical proof standard</a>.
        Because it understands and encompasses the research <em>process</em>,
        Geungle enables collaboration in ways that have never before been
        possible.

      <h3>Built Around the Research Process</h3>

      <p>

        Geungle works the way <%= link_to "research works", "/research/" %>.
        Just as in research, you start with a question. Then, you search for
        answers. As you search, everything you do is tracked as part of your
        research context, called a <em>case</em>. As you find little bits of
        information that could possibly contribute to an answer, you build your
        case. Eventually, you arrive at a "<q cite="http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html">soundly reasoned, coherently written</q>"
        conclusion. 

      </p>
      <p>

        These cases are little bundles of research. They can be shared and used
        to help answer other questions. They can be grouped into projects. You
        can have many cases open at the same time. Whatever the case
        <i>[sic]</i>, you can always look back and see how you came to a
        conclusion. And thanks to Geungle Archive, you can trace a conclusion
        all the way back to the original sources (or digital surrogates). From
        beginning to end, Geungle is there to support your
        research---throughout the whole process.

      <h3>A Holistic Approach</h3>

      <p>

        The past is made up of more than names and dates. In fact, it is the
        little things about an individual's life that make all the difference
        in genealogical research. Often, it is only by understanding these
        little things that we can break through research barriers.

            <dfn id="gh">Generational history</dfn> involves learning more about
            our ancestors than their vital statistics. It means learning their
            stories, who they were, and what their lives were like.

        But what about my family tree, you say? Yes, you can have that too. In
        Geungle it is like a report or overview of your conclusions---a
        snapshot of your research at a certain point in time. 

      </p>
      <p>
        
        The bare bones of names and dates are important, yet my family is more
        interesting than a book full of statistics (at least I think so).
        Geungle puts flesh and blood on those bones and gives a real
        understanding of who that person was and how they fit in their world.
        I want to know their stories and come to know my ancestors. Isn't that
        what family history is all about? Knowing our ancestors helps us
        understand who we are and how we fit in our world a little bit better.

      <h3>Built On Standards</h3>

      <p>

        The field of genealogy is inherently interdisciplinary. We want
        genealogical data to be available in interdisciplinary ways;
        accessible, for example, to historians or social researchers, and not
        stuck in proprietary genealogical data formats. 
        We support <%= link_to "open data", "/open/" %>. 
        Standards are an important means in achieving that. Other fields are
        working on similar problems, and we want to leverage what they are
        doing.

      </p>

      <p>

        Geungle is built upon open standards from several different
        communities:

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Digital Archive</dt>
        <dd>

          Have you ever needed a safe place to store your digital surrogates?
          Geungle Archive is a standards-compliant digital archive used to
          store and publish metadata about source documents.

        </dd>
        <dt>Library</dt>
        <dd>

          This is where we find many of our source documents, so why not
          integrate? 
          
        </dd> 
        <dt>Knowledge Management and the Semantic Web</dt>
        <dd>

          This is where Geungle shines. Using question answering over Topic
          Maps, Geungle learns about your family just as much as you do.

        </dd>
        <dt>Genealogy</dt>
        <dd>

          GEDCOM---for importing those useful (or less-than-useful) sources
          known as family trees.

        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        
        Geungle is designed to interoperate at many levels to make genealogical
        research discoverable and research collaboration a modern reality.

          While this quote is widely attributed to Albert Einstein, we have no
