      <h4>Our Weltanschauung is Open</h4>

      <p>
        Weltanschauung, or <em>world view</em>, has special meaning in genealogical
        research.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        [The closed] world assumption implies that everything we don’t know is
        false, while the open world assumption states that everything we don’t know
        is undefined.
