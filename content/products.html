    <h3 class="big">Our Weltanschauung is Wide Open</h3>

    <p>
      Weltanschauung, or <em>world view</em>, has special meaning in genealogical
      research.
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/91/" class="clearfix">
      <p>
        [The closed] world assumption implies that everything we don’t know is
        false, while the open world assumption states that everything we don’t know
        is undefined.
