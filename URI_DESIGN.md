# URI Design for pentandra.com

Any URI that ends in a `/` refers to the information resource to which it
resolves. A fragment identifier created by a hash following a slash
(`https://pentandra.com/â€¦/#scholarly-commoning`), refers to a section or other
part of that information resource.

Any URI that does not end in a `/` does not refer to an information resource,
but to some other resource, such as a concept.

## Fragment identifier design

Use rich, descriptive fragment identifiers comprised of lower case letters
(unless there is some important reason to do otherwise), separated by the `-`
character. Resource identifiers using hashes should follow the same pattern.

When a resource identifier identifies a document fragment, the resource
identifier may be the same as the fragment identifier. This arrangement makes
logical sense and satisfies [httpRange-14].

### Common fragment identifiers in document structure

```
#title: the title of the document
#document-context: the context of the document
#content: the content of the document
```

### Other fragment identifiers

```
#series: to identify a resource that represents a series of something
```

## Concept-specific RDFa context

A few concepts that are listed as prefixes in the base layout are:

```turtle
# To refer to the company (Pentandra) as an entity
@prefix pentandra: <https://pentandra.com/company#> .

# To refer to the blog as a concept
@prefix pentandra-blog: <https://pentandra.com/blog#> . 

# To refer to the website (located at https://pentandra.com) as a concept
@prefix pentandra-website: <https://pentandra.com#> .
```
