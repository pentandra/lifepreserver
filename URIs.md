# URI Design for pentandra.com

Any URI that ends in a `/` refers to the information resource to which it
resolves. A fragment identifier created by a hash following a slash
(`https://pentandra.com/â€¦/#scholarly-commoning`), refers to a section or other
part of that information resource.

Any URI that does not end in a `/` does not refer to an information resource,
but to some other resource, such as a concept.
