# Extra hunspell dictionaries

This folder contains hunspell dictionaries for spellchecking the [lifepreserver
project](https://github.com/pentandra/lifepreserver).

The primary language of this project is US English, but we include other
languages as well. Special dictionaries for these other languages are found in
subfolders that are named in accordance with the
[BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tag.
